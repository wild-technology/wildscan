# Metadata, XMP sidecars, EXIF, calibration priors

This document covers everything RealityScan 2.2 reads from and writes to per-image
metadata: the `.xmp` sidecar naming contract, the complete `xcr:` attribute schema,
pose/calibration/lens prior semantics, the auto-import trap that silently contaminates
re-runs, the XMP export commands and their parameter keys, EXIF fields RealityScan
actually consumes, and the sensor database `sensorsdb.xml`. It does **not** cover flight
logs, coordinate systems, GCPs or scale (see `06-georeferencing-flightlogs-and-scale.md`),
the `sfm*` alignment keys that govern how priors are weighted (see `03-settings-keys.md`
and `07-alignment.md`), how images get into a scene at all (see
`04-image-input-and-handling.md`), the component/merge machinery that consumes the XMP
census (see `08-components-and-merge.md`), or the structure of `params.xml` files in
general (see `09-xml-parameter-files.md`). Command syntax and exit codes are in
`02-command-reference.md` and `01-cli-fundamentals.md`.

Build under description: `RealityScan.exe` FileVersion `2.2.0.119430.RS`, ProductVersion
`2.2.0.119430`, 45,211,352 bytes, installed at
`C:\Program Files\Epic Games\RealityScan_2.2\`. Several facts below are established by
scanning that binary for both **single-byte ASCII** and **UTF-16LE** string literals
(re-measured 2026-08-04); those are tagged `[UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool]`
and carry two standing caveats: the presence of a string proves the identifier exists in
the build, **not** that a given parser accepts it; and a *count* of a short string is
meaningless unless it is NUL-delimited, because it also matches inside longer words.
Counts quoted below are NUL-delimited unless stated otherwise.

## 1. The sidecar naming contract

### 1.1 `<stem>.xmp` and nothing else

An image and an XMP file of the **same base name** in the **same folder** are treated as
one input; everything in the XMP is assigned to the image on import.
[OFFICIAL: tools/xmpalign] The Help's own example: to attach metadata to `Image01.jpg`,
the file must be `Image01.xmp`.

| image file | sidecar RealityScan reads | sidecar RealityScan ignores |
|---|---|---|
| `C231C1034_20231104201530_edt.jpg` | `C231C1034_20231104201530_edt.xmp` | `C231C1034_20231104201530_edt.jpg.xmp` |

The binding is to the **stem alone, not the image extension** — Epic's reuse-alignment
tutorial says so explicitly, assuming that "the corresponding images from Images1 and
Images2 have the same names, but may differ in their extension" and copying one set of
`.xmp` files across. [OFFICIAL: tutorials/commandline_1] That is precisely why
`image.jpg.xmp` cannot work: its stem is `image.jpg`, and no image is named `image.jpg.jpg`.

**`image.jpg.xmp` is ignored SILENTLY — no warning, no log line, no error code.**
[VERIFIED: NA167 #3 / B7, 2026-07-22] This is a real and expensive bug class, not a
theoretical one: an image batcher in this repo wrote sidecars as
`f"{image_filename}.xmp"`, so **every calibration prior written before 2026-07-22 was
never loaded by any run.** The defect was invisible for months because nothing fails —
alignment simply proceeds without the priors. It was finally caught by an *arithmetic
anomaly in a file count*: after aligning zone_13, 871 "new" `.xmp` files appeared in a
folder that already contained 904 of them. Those 904 were the never-read `*.jpg.xmp`
priors; the 871 were RealityScan's own stem-named pose exports.

Detection rule for any pipeline: **`count(*.xmp) == count(images)` is the invariant.**
A folder holding both naming forms will show roughly 2× the image count.

```bat
:: Audit of a batched zone tree (Windows PowerShell 5.1). Run-verified 2026-08-04
:: on a fixture of a.jpg b.jpg a.xmp b.jpg.xmp -> "images=2 xmp=2 doubleext=1".
powershell -NoProfile -Command ^
  "$r='F:\na156_h2024\batched_images_by_zone\zone_1'; " ^
  "$f=@(Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath $r -Recurse -File); " ^
  "$img=$f.Where({ $_.Extension -in '.jpg','.jpeg','.png' }).Count; " ^
  "$xmp=$f.Where({ $_.Extension -eq '.xmp' }).Count; " ^
  "$bad=$f.Where({ $_.Name -like '*.*.xmp' }).Count; " ^
  "Write-Output \"images=$img xmp=$xmp doubleext=$bad\""
```

**Three cmd/PowerShell traps are already defused in that snippet; a naive version of it
lies to you.** All three run-verified 2026-08-04:

| trap | what happens | fix used above |
|---|---|---|
| `Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath <dir> -Recurse -Include *.jpg` | `-Include` is **silently ignored** when the path carries no wildcard: on the 4-file fixture it returned **5** (every file plus the directory) instead of 2. And `-LiteralPath "$r\*"` cannot fix it — `-LiteralPath` does not expand wildcards, so it errors with `Cannot find path …\*`. | `-File`, then filter on `.Extension` |
| `^` used to continue a line **inside** a quoted string | the caret is passed through verbatim to the child process (`SyntaxError: invalid syntax` from Python; a PowerShell parser error) | carets only ever appear **after** the closing quote |
| `^|` inside a quoted argument | cmd does not treat `\|` as special inside quotes, so the caret survives and PowerShell reports `Unexpected token '^'` | use `.Where({…})` and avoid the pipe entirely |

`-Filter` *is* reliable here: `-Filter *.xmp` and `-Filter *.*.xmp` both returned the right
counts on the fixture. `-Include` is the broken one.

Note the second trap in that snippet: `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` in Windows PowerShell 5.1
does **not** descend into the children of a directory junction, so a zone tree assembled
out of junctions reports `0` sidecars while Python's `os.walk` over the same path reports
all of them (0 vs 9,835 on the same tree). [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-27] The decisive
detail is **where enumeration starts**: PowerShell *does* resolve a junction it is pointed
at directly, so `AlignZone.bat` — handed the zone folder itself — enumerated correctly,
while `MergeZoneComponents.bat` — handed the *parent* of the zone folders — saw the
junctions as children and skipped them. Same tree, same tool, opposite outcome.
[VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-27] See §9.5 and §15.

### 1.2 `_common.xmp` — folder-wide defaults

A single file named `_common.xmp` placed in the image folder applies the same XMP
information to **all** images in that folder. [OFFICIAL: tools/xmpalign, "TIP"] The
literal string `_common.xmp` is present in `RealityScan.exe` (UTF-16LE, one occurrence, in
a filename/mask run reading `… .imagelist | *.* | _common.xmp | .rclicense | …`),
confirming it is a real compiled-in filename and not a doc artifact.
[UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool]

The Help does not state the precedence rule when both `_common.xmp` and `<stem>.xmp`
exist, nor whether `_common.xmp` recurses into subfolders.
[OPEN — see [Open questions](#open-questions), Q1/Q2]

Practical use: a rig with per-camera subfolders can carry one `_common.xmp` per camera
folder instead of one sidecar per image. For the four-camera rig this repo drives, that
would be 4 files instead of 9,835. It has never been exercised here.

```
F:\na156_h2024\batched_images_by_zone\zone_1\
    cinema\   _common.xmp        <- calibration group 3, focal 16.0
    port\     _common.xmp        <- calibration group 2, focal 16.0
```

### 1.3 `-addImageWithCalibration` — decoupled naming

```bat
RealityScan.exe -delegateTo RS1 -addImageWithCalibration ^
  "F:\images\C231C1034_20231104201530_edt.jpg" ^
  "F:\priors\cinema_group3.xmp"
```

Imports one image plus one XMP; the two files need **not** share a name or a folder. Use
whole paths for both. [OFFICIAL: appbasics/allcommands; tools/xmpalign] This is the only
mechanism that breaks the name/location coupling, and it is the correct answer when
priors must live outside a read-only or hard-linked image tree.

Cost note: it is one command per image. At 8,000+ images that is 8,000 delegated
commands; the repo has never used it and has no timing for it.
[OPEN — Q3]

### 1.4 Auto-import on every add

`-add`, `-addFolder` and (by construction) `-addImageWithCalibration` all consume the
sidecar. The critical, undocumented consequence: **any `<stem>.xmp` sitting beside an
image at add time becomes a prior, including pose priors left behind by an earlier
export.** [VERIFIED: NA167 B7, 2026-07-22] See §10 for the full trap and the cleaning
protocol.

## 2. Document structure and namespaces

### 2.1 The canonical sample

Reproduced from the shipped Help, which is the only official statement of the schema
[OFFICIAL: tools/xmpalign]:

```xml
<x:xmpmeta xmlns:x="adobe:ns:meta/">
    <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
        <rdf:Description xmlns:xcr="http://www.capturingreality.com/ns/xcr/1.1#" xcr:Version="3"
            xcr:PosePrior="initial" xcr:Rotation="-1 0 0 0 0 -1 0 -1 0" xcr:Coordinates="absolute"
            xcr:DistortionModel="division" xcr:DistortionCoeficients="0 0 0 0 0 0"
            xcr:FocalLength35mm="18" xcr:Skew="0" xcr:AspectRatio="1" xcr:PrincipalPointU="0"
            xcr:PrincipalPointV="0" xcr:CalibrationPrior="initial" xcr:CalibrationGroup="-1"
            xcr:DistortionGroup="-1" xcr:Rig="{1E204070-A17D-444E-9455-493C15B37B93}"
            xcr:RigInstance="{2DC9F356-432F-4234-9148-DC2655788342}" xcr:RigPoseIndex="3"
            xcr:InTexturing="1" xcr:InMeshing="1">
            <xcr:Position>0.262424475861358 -2.26397531586648 7.03879070281982</xcr:Position>
        </rdf:Description>
    </rdf:RDF>
</x:xmpmeta>
```

### 2.2 Namespaces and the parse path

| prefix | URI | source |
|---|---|---|
| `x` | `adobe:ns:meta/` | [OFFICIAL: tools/xmpalign] + present in binary |
| `rdf` | `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#` | [OFFICIAL] |
| `xcr` | `http://www.capturingreality.com/ns/xcr/1.1#` | [OFFICIAL] |

`http://www.capturingreality.com/ns/xcr/1.1#` is **the only** `capturingreality.com/ns/…`
URI present anywhere in `RealityScan.exe` — one occurrence, ASCII, zero in UTF-16LE. In
particular there is **no** `.../ns/xcr/1.0/` and **no** `.../ns/camera/1.0/`.
[UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool] Honest caveat: that single occurrence sits in
the *licence-certificate* writer's string group (beside `<certificates>`, `xmlns:xcr` and
`<xcr:Cert id="%s">`, see §3), not in a distinct XMP-sidecar string group — the same URI
constant is evidently shared. The Help sample is what fixes it for sidecars
[OFFICIAL: tools/xmpalign]; the binary only establishes that no *other* xcr URI exists.

The binary also contains the literal element path `x:xmpmeta\rdf:RDF\rdf:Description`
(ASCII, immediately adjacent to the XMP value-token pool of §4), which is the reader's
navigation target: RealityScan looks for its attributes on the `rdf:Description` element
beneath `x:xmpmeta/rdf:RDF`. [UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool]

Note that the URI ends in `#`, not `/`. Anything a producer writes bound to a different
URI is, under any conforming XMP/RDF parser, a *different* property.

### 2.3 Attribute form vs element form

Everything except `Position` appears as an **attribute** on `rdf:Description` in Epic's
sample and in RealityScan's own writer. `Position` is written as a **child element**:

```xml
<xcr:Position>0.262424 -2.263975 7.038790</xcr:Position>
```

However, **older exports of this same product wrote `xcr:Position` as an attribute**
(`xcr:Position="x y z"`), so any parser that must read historical sidecars has to accept
both forms. [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-28] This bit an in-repo scale oracle; the fix is
the alternation used in `modules/scale_oracle.py`:

```python
POS_RE = re.compile(r'<xcr:Position>([^<]+)</xcr:Position>|xcr:Position="([^"]+)"')
```

`poses2flightlog.py` has **not** been given the alternation — its
`POSITION_RE = re.compile(r'<xcr:Position>([^<]+)</xcr:Position>')` matches element form
only, so it silently sees zero cameras in a directory of legacy attribute-form sidecars
and exits on the `MIN_CAMERAS = 3` guard.
[VERIFIED-by-inspection: poses2flightlog.py, 2026-08-04]

#### [CONTRADICTED 2026-08-23] RealityScan 2.2 writes `xcr:Rotation` as an ELEMENT too

The rule above — "everything except `Position` is an attribute" — holds for Epic's sample
(`xcr:Version="3"`), but **not** for what RealityScan 2.2.0.119430 actually writes.
Sidecars produced by `-exportXMP` in 15 arms of a 2026-08-23 session are
`xcr:Version="4"` and put **both** `Position` and `Rotation` in element form:

```xml
<rdf:Description xmlns:xcr="..." xcr:Version="4" xcr:ExportCoordinateSystemType="3"
    xcr:PosePrior="initial" xcr:Coordinates="absolute" xcr:DistortionModel="perspective"
    xcr:FocalLength35mm="16.5836" ...>
  <xcr:Position>0.440450977 -1.629441201 -0.349711727</xcr:Position>
  <xcr:Rotation>-0.536007698 -0.843529554 ... -0.995891934</xcr:Rotation>
</rdf:Description>
```

A parser that expects `xcr:Rotation="..."` as an attribute therefore reads **zero
rotations** from current sidecars, the same class of silent-zero bug §2.3 already records
for `Position` in `poses2flightlog.py`. The safe alternation for both:

```python
POS_RE = re.compile(r'<xcr:Position>([^<]+)</xcr:Position>|xcr:Position="([^"]+)"')
ROT_RE = re.compile(r'<xcr:Rotation>([^<]+)</xcr:Rotation>|xcr:Rotation="([^"]+)"')
```

[VERIFIED: onr2 arms A_opk / L_all_levers / E_overlap_high, sidecars written by
RealityScan with no input sidecar present, 2026-08-23]

#### [Q4 — PARTIALLY ANSWERED 2026-08-23] the reader DOES accept attribute form for `Rotation`

Q4 asked whether the *reader* accepts element form for attributes other than `Position`.
The converse direction is now settled for `Rotation`: sidecars written by hand with
`xcr:Rotation="r00 r01 ... r22"` as an **attribute** and `<xcr:Position>` as an **element**
were parsed correctly — RealityScan built a single 392-camera component from them and
echoed the rotations back unchanged to twelve decimal places. So the reader is tolerant of
attribute-form `Rotation` even though its own writer uses element form.

Still open: element form for the *other* attributes (`FocalLength35mm`, `CalibrationGroup`,
…), which was not exercised — every sidecar in that session wrote those as attributes.
[VERIFIED for `Rotation`: onr2 arm N_colmap_locked, 2026-08-23] [OPEN — Q4, remainder]

#### [VERIFIED 2026-08-23] a rewritten sidecar comes back in a different form than it went in

When RealityScan re-exports over a sidecar that was supplied to it, the forms are not
preserved: input `<xcr:Position>` element + `xcr:Rotation` attribute came back as
`xcr:Position` **attribute** + `<xcr:Rotation>` **element**. Do not assume a round-trip
preserves shape — only values. Values themselves survived bit-for-bit
(`Position`, `Rotation`, `FocalLength35mm`), while `CalibrationGroup` and
`DistortionGroup` were reset to `-1` and `DistortionModel` to `perspective` despite a
global `sfmDistortionModel=Brown3`.

### 2.4 Encoding

The Help sample carries no XML declaration. The sidecars this repo writes begin with
`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` and are written UTF-8 **without BOM**
(`open(..., 'w', encoding='utf-8')` in `modules/camera_registry.py`). No BOM-related
sidecar failure has been observed — but a BOM on line 1 of a `.complist` **does** silently
invalidate the first entry, and Windows PowerShell 5.1's `Set-Content -Encoding utf8`
emits one, so never author sidecars with `Set-Content -Encoding utf8`.
[VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-27] Use
`[System.IO.File]::WriteAllLines($p,$lines,(New-Object System.Text.UTF8Encoding($false)))`
if PowerShell must write them.

## 3. The complete `xcr:` attribute set

The table below is the **union** of (a) Epic's sample, (b) the `xcr:`-prefixed identifier
table extracted from `RealityScan.exe`, and (c) attributes referenced elsewhere in the
Help. The binary holds **29** distinct `xcr:` identifiers in total. **26** of them form one
contiguous, NUL-separated ASCII pool — the XMP reader/writer name table — verbatim in
order (each also present once as UTF-16LE):

```
xcr:Rig  xcr:Version  xcr:RigPoseIndex  xcr:RigInstance  xcr:InMeshing  xcr:InTexturing
xcr:ComponentId  xcr:PosePrior  xcr:Rotation  xcr:Coordinates  xcr:DistortionModel
xcr:Position  xcr:FocalLength35mm  xcr:DistortionCoeficients  xcr:AspectRatio  xcr:Skew
xcr:PrincipalPointV  xcr:PrincipalPointU  xcr:CalibrationGroup  xcr:CalibrationPrior
xcr:ExportCoordinateSystemType  xcr:DistortionGroup  xcr:longitude  xcr:latitude
xcr:altitude  xcr:version
```

The other three — `xcr:Gravity`, `xcr:InColoring` (both UTF-16LE only) and `xcr:Cert`
(ASCII only, 4 occurrences) — live elsewhere in the binary and are **not** members of that
pool. [UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool]

Immediately adjacent to the reader's navigation string `x:xmpmeta\rdf:RDF\rdf:Description`
is a second contiguous ASCII pool holding the XMP **value** tokens, in order:

```
perspective  brown4  brown3t2  division  brown3  rationalP2D1T2
[x:xmpmeta\rdf:RDF\rdf:Description]  brown4t2  rationalP2D1
relative  rigid  locked  absolute
```

That is the whole XMP value vocabulary the writer can emit for `xcr:DistortionModel`
(8 tokens, §4.3) and `xcr:Coordinates` (`relative` / `rigid` / `absolute`), plus `locked`
for the prior fields. `initial` and `exact` are a separate adjacent pair in the
project-XML serializer's pool (§4.1). [UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool]

### 3.1 Names that are NOT in the schema

The following occur **zero** times in `RealityScan.exe` — scanned as both single-byte ASCII
and UTF-16LE, with and without a prefix:

| absent string | occurrences (ASCII, UTF-16LE) |
|---|---|
| `LensDistortionGroup` | 0, 0 |
| `LensDistortionPrior` | 0, 0 |
| `DistortionCoefficients` (correctly spelled) | 0, 0 |
| `http://www.capturingreality.com/ns/camera/1.0/` | 0, 0 |
| `http://www.capturingreality.com/ns/xcr/1.0/` | 0, 0 |
| any identifier matching `Camera:[A-Za-z0-9]+` | 0, 0 |

For contrast, `DistortionCoeficients` (Epic's spelling) occurs 3× ASCII + 1× UTF-16LE.

## 4. Value enumerations

### 4.1 `xcr:PosePrior`

| value | Meaning (Help, XMP export dialog wording) |
|---|---|
| `initial` | **draft** — absolute camera positions are used but *are adjusted* during alignment. |
| `exact` | camera **relative** positions are preserved; suitable when spatial relationships between cameras must be kept. |
| `locked` | both relative and absolute positions preserved; positions are **fixed and not adjusted** during alignment. |

The three GUI export modes are literally named "Export as draft", "Export as exact",
"Export as locked". [OFFICIAL: tools/xmpalign]

What the binary actually supports for these three words, measured as NUL-delimited ASCII
C strings [UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool, 2026-08-04]:

| token | where it sits | reading |
|---|---|---|
| `locked` | in the XMP value pool, beside `relative` / `rigid` / `absolute` (§3) | an XMP-writer token |
| `initial`, `exact` | an adjacent pair in the `.rsproj` `<input>` serializer's pool, beside `FocalPrior` / `PrincipalPrior` / `absPrior` and the pose words `pose` `oriented` `registered` `fixed` `disabled` | the prior-hardness vocabulary shared by the project file and (per Epic's sample) the XMP |
| `draft` | one occurrence, in an unrelated part of the binary | **not** an XMP token |

So the XMP prior vocabulary is `{initial, exact, locked}` and the mapping draft→`initial`
is [INFERRED] — Epic's sample uses `initial` for a pose that is "subject to adjustment",
which is exactly the draft semantics, and no `draft` token exists in the XMP pools.

Corroborating: the Selected Input panel documents a "Relative coordinates" field that is
visible "only for the inputs that are connected in a rig (e.g. individual `.lsp` files in
one LiDAR scanner position, **or images with exact or locked XMP files**)".
[OFFICIAL: appbasics/selectedinputs] So `exact`/`locked` sidecars promote a set of images
into a rig-like relative-pose relationship; `initial` does not.

### 4.2 `xcr:CalibrationPrior` and the GUI's Unknown / Approximate / Fixed

The Selected Input panel exposes three levels for both Prior Calibration and Prior Lens
Distortion [OFFICIAL: appbasics/camerasettings_priors, appbasics/selectedinputs]:

| GUI level | Meaning | `-editInputSelection` value | probable XMP token |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unknown | prior values missing or not applied; RealityScan calculates them | `inpCalibration=0` / `inpDistortion=0` | *(attribute omitted)* [INFERRED] |
| Approximate | starting values known, **will be adjusted** during processing | `inpCalibration=1` / `inpDistortion=1` | `initial` [INFERRED] |
| Fixed | values known and **will not be changed** | `inpCalibration=2` / `inpDistortion=2` | `exact` [INFERRED] |

`Approximate` occurs **exactly once** in `RealityScan.exe`, inside a UTF-16LE UI label run
that reads `… Unknown | Approximate | Fixed | No lens distortion | Division | Brown3 |
Brown4 | Brown3 with tangential distortion | Brown4 …` — i.e. it is the dropdown caption,
sitting next to the other dropdown captions, not a serialisation token. Lowercase
`approximate` occurs once and only as the tail of the English word "approximately" in an
unrelated progress message. Neither appears in the XMP value pool or the project-XML prior
pool (§4.1). [UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool, measured 2026-08-04] Do **not**
write `Approximate` as an XMP value on this evidence. [OPEN — Q6]

**Critical and counter-intuitive:** the default lens-distortion state is model *"No lens
distortion"* with prior *"Approximate"*, which means **RealityScan actively searches for a
near-zero-distortion solution** — wrong for any visibly distorted optic. The documented
remedies are to supply real coefficients or to set the lens prior to **Unknown**.
[OFFICIAL: appbasics/camerasettings_priors; appbasics/selectedinputs]

However — and this is a repo finding that supersedes an earlier caution in the same
session — **`Approximate` with NO coefficients supplied does not pin distortion to zero in
practice.** The Cinema camera carried exactly that state and still solved
k1 = −0.0524 over 2,204 cameras. `Unknown` merely withholds a hint.
[VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-25] [SUPERSEDED: the earlier claim that `Approximate` asserts
approximately-zero distortion]

### 4.3 `xcr:DistortionModel` — four different spellings of the same models

**RealityScan spells its distortion models four different ways depending on the interface.
Do not interchange them.**

**(1) XMP `xcr:DistortionModel` — lowercase, 8 tokens**, taken verbatim from the writer's
value pool (§3) [UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool]; `division` is the one Epic's
sample shows [OFFICIAL: tools/xmpalign]:

| XMP token | corresponds to |
|---|---|
| `perspective` | "No lens distortion" |
| `division` | Division |
| `brown3` | Brown3 |
| `brown3t2` | Brown3 with tangential2 |
| `brown4` | Brown4 |
| `brown4t2` | Brown4 with tangential2 |
| `rationalP2D1` | rational model — **no** GUI, `-set` or `-editInputSelection` exposure anywhere in the Help; reachable, if at all, only through XMP. Never tried here |
| `rationalP2D1T2` | ditto, with tangential2 |

The correspondence column is [INFERRED] from the names; only `division` is confirmed by a
document. Note two structural facts that fall out of the list: there is **no XMP token for
the `K+` variants** (consistent with `K+` being an optimise-skew-and-aspect flag on top of
a Brown model rather than a distinct model), and there are **two rational models with no
documented interface at all**. [UNDOCUMENTED: binary value pool]

**(2) The global setting `sfmDistortionModel` — capitalised, 7 values.** Both the Help and
the binary's enum pool (`Division | Brown3 | Brown4 | Brown3WithTangential2 |
Brown4WithTangential2 | KplusBrown3WithTangential2 | KplusBrown4WithTangential2`, one
contiguous UTF-16LE run) agree exactly:

| `sfmDistortionModel` value | Coefficients | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Division` | single parameter | covers simple distortion **and fish-eye optics**; the only model the Help endorses for >= 180° |
| `Brown3` | 3 radial | **application default**; polynomial radial, works for optics under 180° |
| `Brown4` | 4 radial | different distortion at centre vs border |
| `Brown3WithTangential2` | 3 radial + 2 tangential | tangential compensates lens offset |
| `Brown4WithTangential2` | 4 radial + 2 tangential | |
| `KplusBrown3WithTangential2` | + Skew, Aspect | `K+` variants also optimise skew and aspect ratio; without `K+` RealityScan assumes skew 0, aspect 1 |
| `KplusBrown4WithTangential2` | + Skew, Aspect | |

Default `Brown3`. [OFFICIAL: appbasics/settings_distortion_models for the descriptions;
tutorials/setkeyvaluetable for the key, type and default] The seven literal spellings are
independently confirmed as one contiguous UTF-16LE run in the binary.
[UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool, 2026-08-04]

**(3) `-editInputSelection "inpDistortionModel=<n>"` — integers 0–5:**
`0` No lens distortion, `1` Division, `2` Brown3, `3` Brown4, `4` Brown3 with tangential
distortion, `5` Brown4 with tangential distortion.
[OFFICIAL: tutorials/editselectioncommand] Note there is no `K+` option in the per-image
key — `K+` is global-only.

**(4) The camera DB (`sensorsdb.xml`) `<lens type="…">`:** the parser's own string pool —
a contiguous ASCII run reading `cameras | ignore | /cameras | GPSAccuracy | ccdWidth |
brownr4t2 | brownr4 | orientationAccuracy | /camera | GPSMode | brownr3 | lens |
brownr3t2 | brown | focus | /lens | distance` — supplies `brown`, `brownr3`, `brownr3t2`,
`brownr4`, `brownr4t2`. [UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool] `division` is not in
that run (it lives in the XMP value pool) but is the value every `<lens>` in the shipped
`sensorsdb.xml` uses, so it is certainly accepted.
[VERIFIED-by-inspection of the shipped file, 2026-08-04]

### 4.3a Coefficient slot order in `xcr:DistortionCoeficients`

`xcr:DistortionCoeficients` carries **six** floats regardless of model (Epic's sample:
`"0 0 0 0 0 0"`). The Help never states the slot order, but three shipped export templates
in `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\RealityScan_2.2\calibration.xml` do, and they agree:

| format id / desc | emits | order |
|---|---|---|
| `{0CA18733-1EBC-4254-9974-17197EB409BD}` "Internal/External Camera Parameters" | header `#name,x,y,alt,yaw,pitch,roll,f_35mm,px_norm,py_norm,k1,k2,k3,k4,t1,t2` | **`k1 k2 k3 k4 t1 t2`** |
| `{93B7C9C6-2D00-4A4F-B3E7-FBFBFF5C2895}` "Maya 2013 ASCII Scene" | `setAttr -k on ".lensDistortion" -type doubleArray 6 $(k1) $(k2) $(k3) $(k4) $(t1) $(t2);` | **`k1 k2 k3 k4 t1 t2`** |
| `{B5331837-609D-4B12-A931-2863653d19F7}` "OpenCV-compliant Internal/External Camera Parameters" | `…,k1,k2,t2,t1,k3,k4`, header note "Brown lens distortion model coefficients provided in OpenCV ordering" | permuted **for OpenCV**, which is the point |

[OFFICIAL: shipped `calibration.xml`] The native six-slot order is therefore
`k1 k2 k3 k4 t1 t2`, exactly six slots, exactly the width of
`xcr:DistortionCoeficients`. That the XMP attribute uses the *same* order is [INFERRED] —
strongly, but no document says so and no probe here has read a sidecar with non-zero
tangential terms. [OPEN — Q7]

### 4.4 `PrincipalPointU/V` units

**[CONTRADICTED — the Help's GUI label says millimetres, the shipped export templates say
normalised.]**

- **Docs claim:** the Selected Input panel labels the fields "Principal point x **[mm]**"
  / "Principal point y [mm]", "the position of the center of projection on the x axis in
  millimetres"; `-editInputSelection` documents the same keys as
  `inpPPX` / `inpPPY` "Principal point x [mm]".
  [OFFICIAL: appbasics/camerasettings_priors, appbasics/selectedinputs,
  tutorials/editselectioncommand]
- **Shipped templates say otherwise.** In `calibration.xml` the "Internal/External Camera
  Parameters" format `{0CA18733-1EBC-4254-9974-17197EB409BD}` names its columns
  `f_35mm,px_norm,py_norm` and fills them with `$(f*36)`, `$(px)`, `$(py)` — i.e. the
  internal `f` is normalised such that `f*36` is the 35 mm-equivalent millimetre value,
  and `px`/`py` are written **raw** under a column literally named `_norm`. The OpenCV and
  Radiance-Fields templates convert the same variables to pixels with
  `$(px*scale+width*0.5)` / `$(py*scale+height*0.5)`, using the *same* `scale` that turns
  `f` into pixels (`$(f*scale)`). Both are only consistent if `px`/`py` are normalised in
  the same units as `f`. [OFFICIAL: shipped `calibration.xml`]
- **Measured here, consistent with normalised:** cinema median `(−0.0071, −0.0031)`, port
  `(+0.0027, +0.0056)` over 5,050 harvest records
  [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-26]. As millimetres on a 36 mm frame that would be a
  7-micron principal-point offset holding across 5,050 independently solved cameras —
  implausible. As a fraction of frame width it is a 0.7 % offset, which is ordinary.

Treat the "[mm]" label as applying to the GUI field's *presentation* and the XMP / export
value as normalised. What is still unproven is only the arithmetic bridge — whether the
GUI divides by 36, and whether `scale` is image width or the larger image dimension.
[OPEN — Q8]

## 5. Rotation and Position: conventions and frames

### 5.1 `xcr:Rotation`

Nine floats. The Help gives one example, `"-1 0 0 0 0 -1 0 -1 0"`, and says nothing about
row/column order, handedness, or whether it is world→camera or camera→world.

What can be said with a source:

- The shipped `calibration.xml` export template for **OpenCV-compliant
  Internal/External Camera Parameters** documents its own matrix explicitly: *"R = [Rij]
  provided in row major ordering and t = (tx,ty,tz) are the rotation matrix R and the
  translation vector t of the pose (R,t) of the camera"*. That is a world→camera pose in
  row-major order. [OFFICIAL: shipped `calibration.xml`, format
  `{B5331837-609D-4B12-A931-2863653d19F7}`]
- The **Boujou** template restates it independently: *"Camera Rotation Matrix (9 numbers -
  1st row, 2nd row, 3rd row)"* followed by *"rotation applied before translation"*, then
  emits `$(R00) $(R01) $(R02) $(R10) … $(R22) $(tx) $(ty) $(tz)`.
  [OFFICIAL: shipped `calibration.xml`, format `{700E6EE9-C942-41E8-A624-E97BAE13CEA0}`]
- The **CmpMvs `_P` matrices** template is decisive about the direction, because it builds
  a projection matrix in closed form: row 0 is
  `R00*f*scale + R20*(px*scale+0.5*width)`, …, row 2 is `R20 R21 R22 tz` — literally
  `P = K·[R|t]`. A projection matrix maps *world* points to image points, so `R,t` is the
  world→camera pose and `R` is indexed row-major.
  [OFFICIAL: shipped `calibration.xml`, format `{2155D4AC-11BA-421F-8BE8-385EA329EF3B}`]
- Epic's XMP sample matrix `"-1 0 0 0 0 -1 0 -1 0"` is a **proper rotation** — read
  row-major its rows are (−1,0,0), (0,0,−1), (0,−1,0) and its determinant is +1 — so the
  nine floats are a rotation matrix, not a scaled or affine block. (Read column-major it is
  the transpose, determinant also +1, so this check does not settle the ordering.)
- **Nothing states that `xcr:Rotation` uses the same convention as the export variables
  `R00…R22`.** They are different serialisers. [OPEN — Q9]

**This repo has never validated the XMP rotation convention.** `poses2flightlog.py` says
so in its own docstring and deliberately refuses to rewrite orientations for that reason:
registered images get transformed positions, while "yaw/pitch/roll and their accuracies
are carried over from the original log (the XMP rotation convention has not been validated
against the flight-log convention, so orientations are deliberately NOT rewritten)".
[VERIFIED-as-practice: poses2flightlog.py]

Treat "row-major 3×3, world→camera" as [INFERRED] and do not build orientation-critical
logic on it without running the probe in Q9.

### 5.2 `xcr:Position` frame

`xcr:Position` in this pipeline's exports is in a **grid-anchored local Euclidean frame,
not UTM**. The anchor is the project's grid origin. The `xcr:latitude` / `xcr:longitude`
attributes in the same files are garbage.
[VERIFIED: NA167_SESSION_NOTES §1 and poses2flightlog.py, on zone_9]

The consequence is the whole reason `poses2flightlog.py` exists: to recover UTM you must
fit a rigid local→UTM transform (Umeyama, **scale locked at 1**) between the XMP positions
and the matching flight-log rows, then apply it. Fitting scale as well collapses it toward
zero against noise-dominated nav data (0.5 observed on zone_9), so `--allow-scale` is a
diagnostics-only flag. [VERIFIED: poses2flightlog.py, zone_9]

```bat
py -3 C:\Users\jonat\Desktop\CoyoteThings\wildscan\poses2flightlog.py ^
   --images-dir "F:\na156_h2024\batched_images_by_zone\zone_1\cinema" ^
   --flight-log "F:\na156_h2024\batched_images_by_zone\zone_1\flight_log_4Q_UTM.txt" ^
   --position-accuracy 1.0 --registered-only
```

That run also prints the residual distribution (mean / median / p95 / max, metres), which
is a direct estimate of the USBL/DVL navigation error, and writes a per-image residual CSV.

Because `Position` is local, distance **ratios** are still meaningful — that invariance is
what makes the correspondence-free scale oracle possible for fused components whose
sidecars are ordinal and carry no image identity.
[VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-28] Details in `06-georeferencing-flightlogs-and-scale.md`.

Whether `xcr:Position` is UTM in a scene that was georeferenced *before* export has never
been re-tested — hardening cell U13 was written for exactly this and never run.
[OPEN — Q10]

The `xcr:ExportCoordinateSystemType` attribute presumably records which frame was used,
which would make the question answerable from the file itself. Never inspected.
[INFERRED from the attribute name]

## 6. Prior semantics: what each mode actually fixes

### 6.1 The two orthogonal prior families

RealityScan splits "what we know before alignment" into three panels — Prior Pose, Prior
Calibration, Prior Lens Distortion [OFFICIAL: appbasics/camerasettings_priors] — but
operationally there are two families with different plumbing:

| family | what it carries | how it reaches RealityScan here | consumed when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pose priors** | per-image X/Y/Z (+ optional yaw/pitch/roll) and their accuracies | flight log via `-importFlightLog` (see `06-…`), or `xcr:Position`/`xcr:Rotation` in a sidecar | during bundle adjustment, gated by `sfmEnableCameraPrior=true` |
| **Calibration / lens priors** | focal, principal point, skew, aspect, distortion model + coefficients, and the **group ids** | `<stem>.xmp` sidecars, `sensorsdb.xml`, EXIF, or `-editInputSelection` | at import (priors set) and during alignment (as constraints) |

`sfmEnableCameraPrior` **is** the GUI's "use camera priors for georeferencing": pose priors
participate *inside* the bundle adjustment and georeference the resulting components.
It stays `true` in every production align here. [VERIFIED: docs/settings-evaluation-2026-07 §4/§5]

### 6.2 Absolute pose modes

| Absolute pose | `inpPose` | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| Unknown | `0` | nothing known; solve freely |
| Position | `1` | position known to some precision; RealityScan searches for the closest position, **orientation may differ** |
| Position and orientation | `2` | rough position *and* orientation known; both optimisable |
| Locked | `3` | **no changes in camera position or orientation allowed** |

[OFFICIAL: appbasics/camerasettings_priors, appbasics/selectedinputs,
tutorials/editselectioncommand]

### 6.3 Relative pose modes

| Relative pose | `inpPosePriorRelative` | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| Unknown | `0` | relative position between cameras undefined |
| Draft | `1` | relative position known to some precision, optimisable |
| Exact | `2` | relative position known and **not altered** during alignment |

Plus `inpPosePriorRelativeGroup` (string, "Locked pose group"): a positive integer sets a
group; blank or a negative integer ungroups. [OFFICIAL: same]

### 6.4 The hard constraint on Exact/Locked priors

**Pose-locking cannot be used as an incremental growth anchor.**
`-editInputSelection "inpPose=3"` takes effect, but the following `-align` refuses
outright:

> *"prior set to 'Exact' mode must be all aligned in a single run. Incremental adding is
> not supported."*

[VERIFIED: FINDINGS, hardening cell U18 FAIL, 2026-07-23] The practical consequence for a
chunked pipeline is that checkpoint/rollback (copying the `.rsproj` bundle) remains the
only never-shrink mechanism; you cannot freeze a solved component and grow around it.

This is the single most important operational fact about `exact`/`locked` XMP export
modes: **re-importing a `locked` sidecar set and then adding more images will fail the
align.**

### 6.5 Accuracy sources

Per-image accuracies can come from two places, selected by `inpPriorAccuracyInh`:

| `inpPriorAccuracyInh` | source |
|---|---|
| `0` | **Global camera prior settings** — the `sfmCameraPriorAccuracy*` values in Alignment settings |
| `1` | **Edit custom values** — the per-input `inpuTx/inpuTy/inpuTz/inpuRx/inpuRy/inpuRz` values |

[OFFICIAL: tutorials/editselectioncommand, appbasics/camerasettings_priors]

The flight-log import path has its own inheritance switches (`ifuuInhEn`, `ifuuInh`) —
see `06-georeferencing-flightlogs-and-scale.md`. The measured lesson from this repo is
worth repeating here because it is a *prior-content* lesson, not a plumbing one:

> **The accuracy columns want END-TO-END per-image position uncertainty** (timestamp
> matching + nav interpolation + lever arm + dive drift), **not the instantaneous sensor
> spec.** Over-tight position priors fragment solves and wreck metric scale while barely
> moving the registration count — which is exactly why a camera-counting oracle never
> caught it. On a 665-image known-good component: loose 10/10/1 gave **1 component at
> scale 1.049**; tight 1/1/0.1 gave **2 components at 0.886**. Under Division: loose
> **1 component at 0.989**, tight **3 components at 0.826**. Registration moved only
> 656→665 across all four cells. [VERIFIED: PRIORS_DISTORTION_TEST_PLAN "Bow 2×2", 2026-07-25]

### 6.6 Full `-editInputSelection` prior key table

priors on images already in a scene. Usage: select images, then one `-editInputSelection`

### 6.7 Selection-related prior commands

| Command | Effect | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `-setPriorCalibrationGroup <number>` | prior calibration group for the selection; `-1` = do not group | [OFFICIAL: appbasics/allcommands] |
| `-setPriorLensGroup <number>` | prior lens group for the selection; `-1` = do not group | [OFFICIAL] |
| `-setCalibrationGroupByExif` | set calibration groups of **all inputs** from EXIF (not just the selection, per the Help wording) | [OFFICIAL] |
| `-setConstantCalibrationGroups` | group all selected inputs into one calibration group | [OFFICIAL] |
| `-removeCalibrationGroups` | clear **all** inputs from their calibration groups | [OFFICIAL] |
| `-lockPoseForContinue true\|false` | keep relative pose unchanged for the selection in the next registration; registered images only | [OFFICIAL] |
| `-setCamerasGravityDirection [componentID]` | rotate the component so `-z` follows the images' `xcr:Gravity`; applies to the selected component, or to the one named by the id; **sparse cloud (alignment) only — the mesh/dense cloud is not affected** | [OFFICIAL: appbasics/allcommands] — but note the Help's own table prints `componentID` in the **Required Parameter** column while its prose calls it "the optional parameters (component ID)". [CONTRADICTED-internally: appbasics/allcommands] Treat as optional; untested here. |

**`-selectImage` caveat:** in this build `-selectImage` matches **literal full paths only**.
Bare regexp, dot-star-wrapped regexp, glob, and regexp with an explicit `set` modifier all
silently select nothing, despite the Help documenting
`selectImage <imagePath|regexp> [set|union|sub|intersect|toggle]`. Cost is ~0.1–0.3 s per
image, so composing a thousand-image selection is a multi-minute per-image union loop.
[CONTRADICTED: appbasics/allcommands documents a regexp form / observed: only literal full
paths select anything, bisected across probes U-SEL2…U-SEL8, 2026-07-23] This makes
per-camera prior editing via `-editInputSelection` far more expensive than it looks, and
is a large part of why this pipeline uses sidecars instead.

## 7. Calibration groups and lens groups

### 7.1 What a group is

Declaring a calibration group asserts that all images in it share the same intrinsics —
focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients. Groups are useful for fixed-optics
cameras, for **weak-texture / low-feature-count scenes** (fewer parameters to estimate
means fewer feature points needed per camera), and whenever a set of cameras must be
forced to a common focal length. [OFFICIAL: appbasics/camerasettings]

`-1` in either the Calibration group or the Lens group field means *do not group*; any
other integer groups. Images sharing a number share the parameters after alignment.
[OFFICIAL: appbasics/camerasettings, appbasics/selectedinputs]

Epic's own refinement tip: after solving a grouped scene, **ungroup and re-align** to
fine-tune per-camera parameters while the scene is still well-conditioned; the second
align takes seconds. Recommended for weak-texture or small-image-count scenes.
[OFFICIAL: appbasics/camerasettings, "TIP"] This has never been exercised in this
pipeline. [OPEN — Q12]

### 7.2 Automatic grouping and why it is unusable here

`appGroupCalibrationByExif` (bool, default `false`) groups camera parameters automatically
from EXIF at import. [OFFICIAL: tutorials/setkeyvaluetable, appbasics/appsettings]

For the rig this repo drives, **neither setting is correct**:

- The WCA rendered JPGs are **EXIF-identical across physical cameras**: `Make="Z CAM"`,
  `Model="E2-F6"`, matching exposure data, **no focal length tag and no lens tag**,
  4244×2827, Lightroom-rendered from a full-frame sensor. RealityScan cannot tell the
  cameras apart from EXIF at all.
  [VERIFIED-by-inspection: docs/settings-evaluation-2026-07 §1, 2026-07-23]
- Enabled, `appGroupCalibrationByExif=true` would collapse two cameras with different
  lenses (fisheye 14 mm and rectilinear 17 mm) into **one** calibration group.
- Left `false`, images calibrate without any grouping — every camera self-calibrates
  independently, which is weak on low-texture underwater imagery.

**Per-image XMP calibration sidecars are therefore the only mechanism that can separate
EXIF-identical cameras. One group per PHYSICAL camera, never per lens type** — Port and
Starboard share a lens *spec* but are different units with different real intrinsics.
[VERIFIED: docs/settings-evaluation-2026-07 §1–§2]

### 7.3 The rig table this repo encodes

`modules/camera_registry.py` is the single source of truth. Groups, priors and focals are
owner-confirmed 2026-07-23/25.

| Physical camera | Filename families | Optics | CalibrationGroup | LensGroup | Prior | FocalLength35mm | model |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Zeuss | `zeuss` / `herc` (delimiter-bounded token) | rectilinear 23 mm FF | `1` | `1` | Approximate | `23.0` | `brown3` |
| Port | `cammid*`, WCA `P###C*` | fisheye 14 mm FF | `2` | `2` | Approximate | `16.0` | `division` |
| Cinema | `camlower*`, WCA `C###C*` | rectilinear 17 mm FF | `3` | `3` | Approximate | `16.0` | `brown3` |
| Starboard | `camupper*`, WCA `S###C*` | fisheye 14 mm FF | `4` | `4` | Approximate | `16.0` | `division` |

Matching is most-specific-first: anchored WCA prefix `^([pcs])\d+c`, then anchored legacy
prefix, then a delimiter-bounded `zeuss|herc` token. The delimiter bounding exists because
an earlier unanchored `'herc' in name` test ran first and would beat an anchored WCA
prefix. [VERIFIED-by-inspection: modules/camera_registry.py]

Mount geometry (pitch offsets, lever arms) is deliberately **not** in this table — the
same physical Cinema unit sits 10° down under legacy `camlower` names and 45° down under
WCA names, so geometry keys off the *family*, not the camera. Keying mount geometry off
the camera would silently change every legacy dataset by tens of degrees.
[VERIFIED-as-design: modules/camera_registry.py]

### 7.4 Solved intrinsics — the two cameras do separate

Both cameras were given the **same** 16.0 mm focal prior. Over 5,050 harvest records
(4,394 unique cameras; bow members appear in two laps by the successive-difference
design), the solve separated them by 5.6 % with interquartile ranges of about ±0.5 %:

| camera | records | focal 35mm-eq (median) | IQR | division k1 | k1 IQR | principal point | skew | aspect |
|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| cinema (group 3) | 2,558 | **16.374** | 16.302–16.476 | **−0.0378** | −0.0415…−0.0336 | (−0.0071, −0.0031) | 0 | 1 |
| port (group 2) | 2,492 | **15.499** | 15.435–15.574 | **−0.3875** | −0.3933…−0.3832 | (+0.0027, +0.0056) | 0 | 1 |

[VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-26, parsed from the PD-6 identity harvest]

The order-of-magnitude k1 gap is the fisheye declaring itself. The findings log reads this
as "independent confirmation that the sidecar grouping works, not just that it is
written". **Read the caveat in §8 before treating it that way** — an equally consistent
explanation is that each image self-calibrated independently and physics did the
separating. The discriminating measurement is the *within-camera spread*, not the
between-camera gap: a real group forces one focal per group, so the IQR would collapse to
numerical noise rather than the ±0.5 % actually observed. That the IQRs are non-zero is,
if anything, mild evidence **against** the groups having been honoured. Nobody has run the
controlled cell. [INFERRED] [OPEN — Q13]

Exported pose XMPs from that run carry `xcr:CalibrationGroup="-1"` and
`xcr:DistortionGroup="-1"` **alongside** `Camera:CalibrationGroup="3"`. The findings log
records the `-1` as "an export artifact, not a lost grouping"; that interpretation is
itself untested. [VERIFIED-as-observation: FINDINGS 2026-07-26] [UNDOCUMENTED]

### 7.5 `sfmDistortionModel` is GLOBAL and all-or-nothing

**The most consequential contradiction in this document.**

- **Docs claim:** the distortion model is selectable per image through the Prior Lens
  Distortion panel / `inpDistortionModel`, and per image via XMP `DistortionModel`; the
  global setting lives in Alignment Settings → Advanced.
  [OFFICIAL: appbasics/settings_distortion_models, appbasics/camerasettings_priors]
- **Observed, twice, in both directions:**
  - Under global `sfmDistortionModel=Brown3`, **every** exported Port (fisheye) XMP read
    `xcr:DistortionModel="brown3"` despite a `division` sidecar declaration — recorded at
    the time as the prime residuals suspect.
    [VERIFIED: PRIORS_DISTORTION_TEST_PLAN item 3, 2026-07-25]
  - Under global `sfmDistortionModel=Division`, **all 2,558** cinema pose XMPs from PD-6
    came back `xcr:DistortionModel="division"` — identical to the 2,492 port records —
    despite the cinema sidecars declaring `brown3`.
    [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-26, aggregated over 5,050 harvest records; test cell PD-2]
  [CONTRADICTED: docs/settings-evaluation-2026-07 §3 asserted "per-image XMP overrides the
  global key" / observed: the global key owns the model, in both directions]

**Scope caveat that must travel with this finding.** What was declared per image in both
runs was `<Camera:DistortionModel>brown3</Camera:DistortionModel>` — the repo's
**non-schema element** under a namespace URI that does not exist in the binary (§8). §8's
standing doubt and §7.5's contradiction are therefore entangled: "the global key wins" and
"the repo's sidecar was never parsed at all" predict *exactly* the same observation. The
**documented** form — `xcr:DistortionModel="brown3"` as an attribute under
`.../ns/xcr/1.1#` — has never been tested here.
[VERIFIED-as-observation; attribution [OPEN — Q13]]

**Consequence, on the evidence available:** plan for a mixed-optics rig getting **one**
distortion model for the whole scene, with only the *coefficients* differing per
calibration group. Choosing that one model is a global decision. Supplying measured
coefficients remains per-group and therefore still useful. If Q13 shows the documented
attribute form *is* honoured, revisit this.

Measured, on this rig: `Division` globally did **not** degrade the rectilinear cameras.
On Z3 (124 images) Division gave the best registration of the cell series (112/124 vs 102
baseline) and both cameras solved division. On Z1 (4,540) Division produced 4,394/4,540 in
**two** components at hull scale 0.981, against a Brown3 baseline's 4,405 in **three**
components at hull scale 0.175. [VERIFIED: PD-1, PD-6, 2026-07-25] PD-6's attribution is
not clean — it changed three things at once (Brown3→Division, accuracy columns importing
for the first time, orientation priors removed) — so do not attribute the scale repair to
Division alone. [VERIFIED-as-caveat: FINDINGS 2026-07-26]

Epic's own strategy note is compatible: start with the simpler Division model, then switch
to Brown and re-align to optimise. [OFFICIAL: appbasics/settings_distortion_models, "TIP"]

## 8. The production calibration sidecar in this repo — and the doubt about it

### 8.1 What is actually written

`modules/camera_registry.calibration_xmp()` produces, per image:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<x:xmpmeta xmlns:x="adobe:ns:meta/" xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
  <rdf:RDF>
    <rdf:Description xmlns:Camera="http://www.capturingreality.com/ns/camera/1.0/" xmlns:xcr="http://www.capturingreality.com/ns/xcr/1.0/">
      <Camera:CalibrationGroup>3</Camera:CalibrationGroup>
      <Camera:CalibrationPrior>Approximate</Camera:CalibrationPrior>
      <xcr:FocalLength35mm>16.0</xcr:FocalLength35mm>
      <Camera:LensDistortionGroup>3</Camera:LensDistortionGroup>
      <Camera:LensDistortionPrior>Approximate</Camera:LensDistortionPrior>
      <Camera:DistortionModel>brown3</Camera:DistortionModel>
    </rdf:Description>
  </rdf:RDF>
</x:xmpmeta>
```

It carries **no pose entries by design** — exported pose sidecars auto-import as priors
(§10), and pose priors measurably reduced registration on NA167 (§11).

### 8.2 Five ways this diverges from the documented schema

| # | Divergence | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Element form**, not attribute form, for everything | Epic's sample uses attributes on `rdf:Description` for all fields except `Position` [OFFICIAL: tools/xmpalign] |
| 2 | Prefix `Camera:` bound to `http://www.capturingreality.com/ns/camera/1.0/` | Neither the prefix `Camera:` nor the URI `.../ns/camera/1.0/` occurs anywhere in `RealityScan.exe` [UNDOCUMENTED: binary string pool] |
| 3 | `xcr` bound to `.../ns/xcr/**1.0/**` | The only `xcr` URI in the binary is `.../ns/xcr/**1.1#**` [UNDOCUMENTED: binary] |
| 4 | Names `LensDistortionGroup` / `LensDistortionPrior` | Neither string occurs in the binary in any form; the schema's names are `DistortionGroup` and (probably) `CalibrationPrior`-style `…Prior` tokens [UNDOCUMENTED: binary] |
| 5 | Value `Approximate` for the prior fields | `approximate` (lowercase) occurs 0 times in the binary; `Approximate` once, as a UI label. The XMP prior token set is `{initial, exact, locked}` [UNDOCUMENTED: binary] |

Under any conforming XMP/RDF parser, divergences 2–5 mean the `Camera:*` elements resolve
to properties RealityScan has no name for. Under divergence 3, even `xcr:FocalLength35mm`
resolves to a *different* property than `.../xcr/1.1#FocalLength35mm`.

**Cheapest diagnostic that has never been run:** the binary carries the format strings
`Skipping unexpected attribute, %s=%S` and `Skipping unexpected tag %s`. If the XMP reader
shares the app's XML diagnostics, a single align over one image with a repo-form sidecar
would leave those lines in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\RealityScan.log` — and their absence, with
a `Camera:CalibrationGroup` element present, would be equally informative. Snapshot the log
immediately; the next instance boot truncates it (NA167 B6).
[UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool] [INFERRED — the strings were found in the
project-XML parser's neighbourhood, not a distinct XMP one]

### 8.3 But something is being read — the counter-evidence

Two measured results say the sidecars are not inert:

1. **Fragmentation.** A fresh end-to-end run with calibration sidecars gave zone_1
   **3 components at 4,405/4,540 (97.0 %)** against the pre-sidecar production run's
   **9 components at 4,392 (96.7 %)** on the same imagery and the same box.
   [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-24; docs/FRESH_RUN_2026-07-24.md]
2. **Sidecar loss is treated as a defect.** When the identity harvest stripped 796 of
   4,540 sidecars (§9.6), the pipeline gained a repair function rather than shrugging.

Both are weaker than they look:

- The 9→3 comparison is **fresh run vs production run**, not a controlled A/B. The zone
  boundaries differed (the bow landed inside zone_1 "this time"), and *alignment
  fragmentation is independently established as strongly nondeterministic* — the same
  4,540 images with identical settings and inputs produced 2 components / 4,391 cameras in
  one run and 9 components / 4,392 in another. [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-24]
- The 5.6 % focal separation in §7.4 is fully explained by physics alone: a fisheye and a
  rectilinear lens self-calibrating independently *should* separate, with or without
  groups.
- `Camera:*` tags appearing "echoed back in exports" was read as evidence the tags are
  honoured [VERIFIED-as-observation: PRIORS_DISTORTION_TEST_PLAN item 4, 2026-07-25]. It
  is not. The XMP exporter has a *"Merge with existing XMP files"* option
  [OFFICIAL: tools/xmpalign], and **unrecognised content surviving an export is exactly
  what a merging writer does** — a byte-preserving passthrough proves nothing about
  comprehension. Note the mechanism carefully: the repo's `XMPExportParams.xml`
  (`xmpMerge=true`) is passed to **nothing** (§9.7), so the merge state in force was the
  unpinned instance default. The observed file — `xcr:CalibrationGroup="-1"` written by
  RealityScan **alongside** a surviving `Camera:CalibrationGroup="3"` written by this repo
  [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-26] — is itself the evidence that the default preserves
  pre-existing XMP content. [INFERRED, from that co-presence]

### 8.4 Standing conclusion

**The production sidecar format is not the documented format, the divergences are
mechanically significant, and no experiment in this repo isolates the sidecars from
everything else that changed.** Do not copy this format into new work. Write the
documented attribute form under `.../ns/xcr/1.1#` unless and until Q13 settles it.

For a new rig, the format that has *documentation* behind it is:

```xml
<x:xmpmeta xmlns:x="adobe:ns:meta/">
    <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
        <rdf:Description xmlns:xcr="http://www.capturingreality.com/ns/xcr/1.1#"
            xcr:Version="3"
            xcr:CalibrationPrior="initial" xcr:CalibrationGroup="3" xcr:DistortionGroup="3"
            xcr:FocalLength35mm="16.0" xcr:Skew="0" xcr:AspectRatio="1"
            xcr:PrincipalPointU="0" xcr:PrincipalPointV="0"
            xcr:DistortionModel="brown3" xcr:DistortionCoeficients="0 0 0 0 0 0"/>
    </rdf:RDF>
</x:xmpmeta>
```

(No `xcr:PosePrior`, no `xcr:Position`, no `xcr:Rotation` — a calibration-only sidecar, so
that nothing here can become a pose prior on a later add.)

**Two traps in that template.** (1) `xcr:DistortionCoeficients="0 0 0 0 0 0"` is copied
from Epic's sample, where it is filler. Written for real under
`xcr:CalibrationPrior="initial"` it *asserts* zero distortion as a starting value — which
is the same trap as the app's own "No lens distortion + Approximate" default (§4.2).
**Omit the attribute entirely unless you have measured coefficients**, and measure them
under the distortion model that will actually be in force (a Division λ is not a Brown3
k1). [VERIFIED-as-principle: FINDINGS 2026-07-25] (2) Per §7.5, `xcr:DistortionModel` may
be ignored in favour of the global `sfmDistortionModel`; set the global key to match rather
than relying on this attribute.

**A completely independent, doc-sanctioned alternative that avoids the whole question:**
put the intrinsics in `sensorsdb.xml` instead (§13) — but that only works if the cameras
are distinguishable by `tiff:Model` / `aux:Lens`, which this rig's EXIF-identical JPGs are
not. The other alternative is `-editInputSelection` with `inpCalibrationGroup` /
`inpLensGroup` / `inpFocal` / `inpDistortionModel` after import (§6.6), which is fully
documented but requires per-image selection and therefore pays the `-selectImage`
literal-path cost.

## 9. Exporting XMP

### 9.1 The two commands

| Command | Scope | Sidecar naming | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-exportXMP [params.xml]` | camera metadata of components created in **the last alignment**; gated by `-setMinComponentSize` | **stem-named** `<stem>.xmp` | [OFFICIAL: appbasics/allcommands] + [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-23] |
| `-exportXMPForSelectedComponent` | camera metadata of the **selected component**, using current settings (no params argument) | **ordinal** `00000.xmp`, `00001.xmp`, … | [OFFICIAL: appbasics/allcommands] + [CONTRADICTED/UNDOCUMENTED], see §9.3 |

Both write **next to the respective images**, wherever those live — the Help states this
explicitly for both commands ("XMP files are stored in the same folder as the respective
images"). [OFFICIAL: appbasics/allcommands] There is no output-directory argument.

`-exportXMP` accepts an optional params XML exported from the XMP metadata export dialog;
`-exportXMPForSelectedComponent` accepts none and always uses "the current settings" —
i.e. whatever the instance's XMP export dialog state happens to be.

Process ids, for `-writeProgress` / `appProcessExecCmd` filtering:
**`20584 EXPORT_XMP`** and **`20568 EXPORTING_RIGGING_XMP_FILES`**.
[OFFICIAL: tutorials/processids]

### 9.2 The naming rule: the COMMAND decides, not the scene

An earlier hypothesis in this repo held that stem naming required a live aligning session.
That was **wrong** and is superseded. Four consistent datapoints establish:
`-exportXMP` → stems; `-exportXMPForSelectedComponent` → ordinals, in every observed
context. [SUPERSEDED: the session-based hypothesis] [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-23,
NA167 B10 final form]

Note the in-repo tension: `testing/NA167_SESSION_NOTES.md` §1 still describes
`-exportXMPForSelectedComponent` as writing `<stem>.xmp`, while the same file's **B10**
entry and `FINDINGS.md` record ordinals. The B10/FINDINGS reading is the current one and
the workflows are built on it. [CONTRADICTED-in-repo: NA167_SESSION_NOTES §1 vs B10]

This is why per-component membership is derived by **successive difference**: each lap
`-exportXMP` writes stems for all remaining components, the harvest moves them to
`identity_r<K>`, then the maximal component is renamed, exported and deleted.
`members(c_K) = stems(r_K) − stems(r_{K+1})`.
[VERIFIED-by-inspection: `RS_CLI/Scripts/AlignZone.bat`]

Worked example, zone_1: lap sidecar counts `2619 / 985 / 593 / 248 / 133 / 64 / 0` →
successive differences `1634 / 392 / 345 / 115 / 69 / 64`, reproducing all six component
sizes to the camera. [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-27]

**Directory semantics differ between scene types:** in an ALIGN scene, `identity_r<K>` is
**cumulative** (lap K holds laps K..end); in a MERGE scene, `r<K>` is component K alone.
Component K's own sidecars in an align scene are the stem difference `r_K` minus `r_{K+1}`.
[VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-28]

Ordinal sidecars are **inert as priors** (no image has an ordinal stem), which is why
`camera_registry.sanitize_and_census` deletes them quietly rather than restoring them.
[VERIFIED: B10, 2026-07-23]

### 9.3 Ordinal naming and imported components

`-exportXMPForSelectedComponent` on a component built from `-importComponent`-ed
`.rsalign` files writes `00000.xmp`, `00001.xmp`, … beside the images.
[VERIFIED: NA167 B10, NA156 smoke merge 2026-07-23] The count is still a valid
registration census; **per-camera identity is only available from `-exportXMP` in the
original aligned scene.**

Practical consequence for the scale oracle: fused components come back UNMEASURED under a
stem-pairing oracle because there is nothing to join on. The correspondence-free quantile
oracle exists specifically to work around this. [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-28]

### 9.4 Two preconditions that silently produce nothing

**(a) Clear the selection first.** Flight-log import leaves its matched images **actively
selected**, and selection-driven exports under `-silent` then export **nothing** — the
"Export Selection" dialog is auto-answered. The signature is a suspiciously fast
completion: **0.057 s instead of 20.5 s**. `-deselectAllImages` before every export step is
mandatory. [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-23] [UNDOCUMENTED: the Help does not warn that
import leaves a selection]

**(b) Set `-setMinComponentSize 1`.** The default is **5**, and components below the
threshold are silently excluded from `-exportXMP` **and** from `-exportLatestComponents`
**and** from selection. [OFFICIAL: appbasics/allcommands for the gate and the default]
[VERIFIED: HANDOFF 2026-07-21] The command is officially **deprecated** in 2.2 — the app
log carries "will be removed in the next release" — but remains required.
[VERIFIED: NA167 #22 / B11, 2026-07-24]

```bat
call :run -deselectAllImages          || goto :fail
call :run -setMinComponentSize 1      || goto :fail
call :run -exportXMP                  || goto :fail
```

### 9.5 The reparse-point silent no-write

**RealityScan writes NO XMP sidecars when a scene's images resolve through a reparse point
(directory junction), and reports success.**

Measured: four baseline components on real paths harvested `identity_r0` = 267 files
(= 116 + 94 + 57, the exact camera count), ordinal-named, all pose-bearing; `r1` 116,
`r2` 94, `r3` 57, `r4` 0. The same workflow on junction-rooted components harvested
**zero**, silently. The instance log read "Exporting Registration completed in 8.758
seconds" and a sweep of the entire drive found zero `.xmp` written and zero sidecars
carrying `xcr:Position` — the exact string the harvest filters on.
[VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-27, "RESOLVED BY PROBE"] [UNDOCUMENTED: no Epic coverage of
reparse-point behaviour]

Cost of the misdiagnosis, exactly: **155 min** of GPU work discarded on the first run
(blamed on the read-side junction trap, §1.1), then **157 min** more across **18 attempts**
(cluster_0 ×3, cluster_1 ×15) on a re-run that cleared only the read side — the components
were still exported from junction paths, so the write side was never tested until the
baseline probe. [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-27]

Ruled out by measurement: "an imported component carries no images" — the merge scene
reported `Added 1407 images` / `1217` / `2241`.

The fix that was verified: replace per-zone junctions with **real directories of
hard-linked `.jpg`** (9,835 files, 35.8 GB logical, 0.05 GB actual) plus **copied** `.xmp`
and flight logs. Sidecars are deliberately not hard-linked so a v2 write cannot corrupt the
baseline's. No re-align was needed — the components were never the problem, only the paths
baked into them. [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-28]

There is a *separate*, also-true junction fact that was mistaken for the cause for 157
minutes: PowerShell 5.1's `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` does not descend into junction
*children* (0 vs 9,835 `.xmp` on the same tree via its real path), while Python's
`os.walk` crosses junctions in both directions. That is a **read**-side trap; the export
failure was on the **write** side. [SUPERSEDED-as-cause; VERIFIED-as-fact: FINDINGS 2026-07-27]

**Rule:** never hand a RealityScan workflow — or a harvest — a path whose components are
reparse points. An empty harvest beside a non-empty component export must abort the run as
an instrument failure, not be scored as "nothing fused". [VERIFIED-as-fix: FINDINGS 2026-07-28]

### 9.6 The harvest strips calibration sidecars — and the required repair

The identity harvest **moves** every pose-bearing `.xmp` into `identity_r<K>`:

```bat
powershell -NoProfile -Command "Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath '%input_dir%' -Recurse -Filter *.xmp | Where-Object { Select-String -LiteralPath $_.FullName -Pattern 'xcr:Position' -Quiet } | Move-Item -Destination '%output_dir%\identity_r%comp_index%' -Force"
```

The last-peeled component's sidecars are never re-exported, so those images are left with
**no calibration prior at all**. Measured on fresh zone_1: **796 of 4,540 images (17.5 %)
had no sidecar** — the entire bow component (665/665), 123 of c0, and 8 unregistered
images. Any re-align of an already-harvested zone then silently runs with a partially
ungrouped camera set. **Test cells PD-4 and PD-4a both re-aligned zone_1 in that state, so
their "collapse" results (669 and 782 of 4,540) are CONFOUNDED.**
[VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-25]

The repair is `camera_registry.ensure_calibration_sidecars(image_root)`, called after every
zone align: it walks the tree and recreates a calibration-only XMP for every
`.jpg/.jpeg/.png/.heif` that has none, returning `(created, unknown_camera_skipped)`.

Two further hazards in that one PowerShell line, both recorded:

- PowerShell 5.1 exits 0 on non-terminating pipeline errors, so `if errorlevel 1` cannot
  see a partial move — two locked sidecars are a silent −2.
- A flat `-Force` move **collapses same-stem ordinal sidecars arriving from different
  folders**. [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-27]

Together these mean a small camera deficit after a fusion (e.g. 3,740 → 3,738) is **not
distinguishable from a harvest artifact** on the current instrument. [OPEN — Q14]

### 9.7 XMP export settings (`xmp*` keys)

`-exportXMP` takes an optional params XML exported from the XMP metadata export dialog.
The repo carries `RS_CLI/Metadata/XMPExportParams.xml`:

```xml
<Configuration id="{EC40D990-B2AF-42A4-9637-1208A0FD1322}">
  <entry key="xmpMerge" value="true"/>
  <entry key="xmpExGps" value="true"/>
  <entry key="xmpFlags" value="true"/>
  <entry key="xmpCalibGroups" value="true"/>
  <entry key="xmpCamera" value="3"/>
  <entry key="xmpRig" value="true"/>
</Configuration>
```

**This file is referenced by no script in the repository** — `AlignZone.bat` calls bare
`-exportXMP` and `MergeZoneComponents.bat` calls `-exportXMPForSelectedComponent`, which
takes no params at all. Production exports therefore run on **whatever the instance's
current XMP dialog state is**, which is unpinned.
[VERIFIED-by-inspection, 2026-08-04]

**No `xmp*` key is documented anywhere in the shipped Help.** `allcommands` and
`tutorials/commandline_1` both say of `-exportXMPForSelectedComponent` that *"an example
is available in the paragraph 'Metadata (XMP) Export Settings' below"* — **that paragraph
does not exist in the shipped Help**; a full-text grep over
`C:\Program Files\Epic Games\RealityScan_2.2\Help\en-US\*\*.htm` finds only the two
references and no target, and finds zero occurrences of `xmpMerge`, `xmpCamera`,
`xmpExGps`, `xmpFlags`, `xmpCalibGroups` or `xmpRig`.
[CONTRADICTED: the Help promises a worked XMP-export-settings example / no such section
ships, verified by grep 2026-08-04]

Everything below therefore comes from the binary. Two adjacent UTF-16LE runs exist — a
**key** run and a **label** run:

```
keys:    xmpRig  xmpCalib  xmpEnabledOnly  xmpMerge  xmpFlags  xmpCalibGroups
         xmpImageList  xmpExGps  xmpPrecision  xmpPose        [+ xmpCamera, xmpComponentMode, xmpPath]
labels:  CameraExportMode  xmpCamera  EnabledCamerasOnly  MergeWithExistingFiles
         precision_int  Precision  pose_int  Pose  ComponentMode  xmpComponentMode
         Calibration  component_mode_int  Rig  CalibrationGroups  ReplaceGPSExif
         UseConfigFlags  .xmp  .bak
```

[UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool, 2026-08-04] Only `CameraExportMode` ↔
`xmpCamera` and `ComponentMode` ↔ `xmpComponentMode` are adjacent; the rest of the
key↔label pairing below is by name correspondence and by matching the label set against
the dialog fields the Help does document [OFFICIAL: tools/xmpalign], i.e. [INFERRED]:

| Key | Internal label | Export dialog field | Repo value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `xmpCamera` | `CameraExportMode` | **Camera export mode** — draft / exact / locked | `3` |
| `xmpMerge` | `MergeWithExistingFiles` | **Merge with existing XMP files** (new files replace existing ones when off) | `true` |
| `xmpRig` | `Rig` | **Export rigging setup** (position+orientation only when off) | `true` |
| `xmpCalibGroups` | `CalibrationGroups` | **Export camera calibration groups** | `true` |
| `xmpFlags` | `UseConfigFlags` | **Include editor options** — writes `xcr:InTexturing` / `xcr:InMeshing` | `true` |
| `xmpExGps` | `ReplaceGPSExif` | **Replace GPS Exif with optimized values** — use alignment-computed coordinates instead of EXIF | `true` |
| `xmpEnabledOnly` | `EnabledCamerasOnly` | limit export to enabled cameras | — |
| `xmpPose` | `Pose` (`pose_int`) | pose export selector | — |
| `xmpCalib` | `Calibration` | calibration export toggle | — |
| `xmpPrecision` | `Precision` (`precision_int`) | numeric precision | — |
| `xmpComponentMode` | `ComponentMode` (`component_mode_int`) | which components are covered | — |
| `xmpImageList` | — | image-list companion file | — |
| `xmpPath` | — | export path | — |

**`xmpCamera=3` is unexplained.** The dialog offers three modes; if the enum is
`1`=draft, `2`=exact, `3`=locked then the repo's (unused) preset asks for **locked**
export — which, re-imported, would refuse any incremental align (§6.4). A `0`-based enum
with a fourth "no pose" state is equally possible. The mapping is not established.
[OPEN — Q15]

One further, low-confidence read of the same pool: `.xmp` and `.bak` are adjacent string
constants in the XMP-export label run, which would be consistent with the writer keeping a
`.bak` of a sidecar it overwrites. No `.bak` file has ever been observed beside an image in
this pipeline. [INFERRED, weak]

### 9.8 The registration-export route

The other way to produce XMP is the Registration export: set the save type to
**"RealityScan XMPs with Image List"**, which is format id
`{B95BEEA0-5E3C-49FC-9823-97AAD709D1BF}`, mask `*.imagelist`, writer
`RealityScan.Export.XMP`, `requires="component"`.
[OFFICIAL: shipped `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\RealityScan_2.2\calibration.xml`]
The CLI equivalent is `-exportRegistration <fileName> [params.xml]`.

**`-exportRegistration` without a params XML BLOCKS FOREVER headless.**
[VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-21] The only way to obtain a valid params file is to export it
once from that tool's GUI dialog; no such file exists in this repo, so the command is
unusable here. See `09-xml-parameter-files.md`.

That dialog adds settings the `-exportXMP` dialog does not have: undistortion settings,
image export, and **Export transformation settings** (coordinate system, scene move /
rotate / scale, normal transformation). [OFFICIAL: tools/exportregistration]

### 9.9 Sidecar counting IS the registration census

**Only registered cameras get pose entries.** Counting pose-bearing sidecars is therefore a
reliable registration census and is this pipeline's primary oracle.
[VERIFIED: NA167_SESSION_NOTES §1]

The filter is the literal string `xcr:Position` — which is exactly why the
element-vs-attribute form matters (§2.3) and why a component `.rsalign` (opaque `TBSM`
binary, ~0.7 GB per ~1.5k cameras, no readable camera list) cannot substitute.
[VERIFIED: NA167_SESSION_NOTES §1]

Census implementation, returning `(pose_count, restored, removed)`:

```python
# modules/camera_registry.py — sanitize_and_census(image_root)
if 'xcr:Position' not in content:
    continue                        # already calibration-only; NOT counted
pose_count += 1
camera = identify(filename)
if camera is not None:
    write(calibration_xmp(camera))  # restore calibration-only content
    restored += 1
    continue
os.remove(path)                     # unrecognised camera: the pose file goes
if os.path.splitext(filename)[0].isdigit():
    continue                        # ordinal sidecar - expected, warn about nothing
removed += 1                        # anything else is a real surprise; log it
```

Note the third counter's meaning: **every** unrecognised-camera sidecar is deleted, but
only *non-ordinal* ones increment `removed` and trigger the warning — an ordinal stem is
the expected shape after `-exportXMPForSelectedComponent` (§9.3), so it is deleted
silently. A non-zero `removed` means a real image whose filename `camera_registry.identify`
could not classify. [VERIFIED-by-inspection: modules/camera_registry.py]

**Read the census BEFORE sanitising** — sanitising destroys the evidence.
`modules/component_manifest.py` documents this ordering constraint explicitly.

## 10. The auto-import trap and the cleaning protocol

### 10.1 The trap

`-add` and `-addFolder` **auto-import any `<stem>.xmp` sitting next to an image**, and a
pose-bearing sidecar silently becomes a pose prior. [VERIFIED: NA167 B7, 2026-07-22]
Because RealityScan's own exports land beside the images (§9.1), the default lifecycle is:

```
run 1:  -addFolder  ->  -align  ->  -exportXMP   (writes poses beside every image)
run 2:  -addFolder  ->  the run-1 poses are now priors
```

Run 2 is no longer an independent measurement of anything. Epic documents this as a
*feature* — the "Export XMP to reuse alignment" tutorial copies `Images1/*.xmp` into
`Images2/` precisely so that the second project inherits camera positions and calibration:

```bat
RealityScan.exe -load %MyPath%\Project1.rsproj -exportXMP -quit
copy Images1\*.xmp Images2\
RealityScan.exe -addFolder %MyPath%\Images2\ -align -save %MyPath%\Project2.rsproj -quit
```

[OFFICIAL: tutorials/commandline_1] It becomes a trap only when it is not intended, which
in an automated multi-run pipeline is nearly always.

The strength of the inherited prior is whatever `xcr:PosePrior` the export wrote, which is
governed by the unpinned `xmpCamera` export mode (§9.7). This repo's B7 entry records the
inherited priors as **exact-pose** priors; the actual token in the exported files has never
been read. [VERIFIED-as-effect: NA167 B7] [OPEN — Q16]

### 10.2 The cleaning protocol in force

After every census, the image tree is restored to **calibration-only** content:

1. `sanitize_and_census(image_root)` — walk every `.xmp`; skip files without
   `xcr:Position`; for pose-bearing files, count them, then either rewrite the file with
   `calibration_xmp(camera)` (recognised camera) or delete it (unrecognised camera, e.g.
   ordinal sidecars). Returns `(pose_count, restored, removed)`.
2. `ensure_calibration_sidecars(image_root)` — recreate a calibration-only XMP for every
   image left without one, because the harvest **moved** files out of the tree rather than
   rewriting them (§9.6). Returns `(created, unknown_camera_skipped)`.

Invariants worth asserting in any pipeline that does this:

| Invariant | Why |
|---|---|
| `count(*.xmp) == count(images)` after step 2 | catches both the `image.jpg.xmp` bug class and harvest stripping |
| `0 == count(files containing 'xcr:Position')` after step 1 | proves no pose prior survives into the next run |
| harvest moved > 0 sidecars whenever the exported component was non-empty | an empty harvest is otherwise indistinguishable from a legitimately empty scene [VERIFIED-as-fix: FINDINGS 2026-07-28] |

A verified end-to-end example of the whole chain working (smoke `mini_a`): align → save →
destructive harvest loop → quit-without-saving produced `.rsalign` + manifest (118 members
by real basename, UTM bbox), census from manifests equal to the original registration, and
**zero pose sidecars left beside images**. [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-23]

### 10.3 Why quit-without-saving is safe here

`-quit` without saving leaves the `.rsproj` bundle **byte-stable** across load / delete /
export cycles — hash-verified twice. That is what makes the destructive in-memory identity
harvest safe. [VERIFIED: FINDINGS, cells U15/U16, 2026-07-23]

## 11. Measured effect of priors

### 11.1 Priors are not automatically beneficial

**96.3 % → 89.6 %** on Zeuss, zone_13, NA167. The A/B compared priors *absent* (because
they had been written as `image.jpg.xmp` and were therefore never loaded — see §1.1)
against priors *promoted* to the correct `<stem>.xmp` naming. Adding the priors **cost
6.7 points of registration.** Sidecar generation became opt-in
(`batch_xmp_priors`, default off) as a direct result.
[VERIFIED: NA167 #4 / B7, 2026-07-22]

**The conditions matter and largely explain the result.** The writer of that era grouped
`cammid` + `camupper` + `camlower` into one group at "12 mm fisheye", when `camlower` is
in fact a **rectilinear 17 mm** camera. Wrong focal, wrong model, wrong grouping — a
confidently-asserted lie is worse than silence.
[VERIFIED: docs/settings-evaluation-2026-07 §2]
[SUPERSEDED-in-scope: the corrected per-camera values reverse the calculus; validate per
rig before trusting either direction]

**Standing rule: a calibration prior is a claim about physics. Validate the claim before
shipping it, and treat "priors improve alignment" as a hypothesis per rig, not a law.**

### 11.2 The counter-result

With corrected per-camera groups and focals, sidecars at align time were associated with
zone_1 going from **9 components at 4,392 (96.7 %)** to **3 components at 4,405/4,540
(97.0 %)** — same imagery, same box. [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-24] Attribution caveats

### 11.3 Pose-prior effects (flight-log route)

Full treatment is in `06-georeferencing-flightlogs-and-scale.md`; the headlines that bear
on prior *content*:

| result | numbers | source |
|---|---|---|
| Configuration alone, no data change, rescued a zone | zone_2 **101/852 (11.9 %) → 812/852 (95.3 %)** with Division + orientation @15° + real accuracies | [VERIFIED: PD-2b, 2026-07-25] |
| Over-tight position priors fragment and shrink scale | see the 2×2 in §6.5 | [VERIFIED: 2026-07-25] |
| Removing orientation priors **destroyed** two zones | position-only re-align: zone_3 and zone_5 registered **nothing at all** — zero components after 12.7 and 32.4 minutes | [VERIFIED: HANDOFF 2026-07-27] |
| Orientation-prior attribution is contaminated | Euler order and "Camera mount" are unpinned in `FlightLogParams.xml`; counts stand, attribution does not | [VERIFIED-as-flag: FINDINGS 2026-07-26] |

**Unresolved tension between rows 1 and 2, stated rather than smoothed over.** PD-2b's
zone_2 rescue ran at accuracies **1/1/0.1** — exactly the "tight" setting that fragmented
the bow and pushed its scale to 0.886 in §6.5. Both results are real; each changed more
than one thing (PD-2b also switched to Division and added orientation priors, the bow 2×2
did not). The reconciliation the findings log offers is that the accuracy column should
carry *end-to-end* per-image uncertainty, and that 1/1/0.1 is honest for one dataset and
dishonest for another — but no cell isolates it. Do not read "tight priors are bad" as a
law. [OPEN — attribution]

### 11.4 A cross-engine echo worth knowing

COLMAP on zone_9 **registered** 710 Zeuss frames but **triangulated zero points** from
them. Two engines, two failure shapes, one physical camera family — treat Zeuss
calibration and imagery as suspect.

## 12. EXIF handling

### 12.1 Which metadata fields RealityScan actually consumes

Extracted from the binary's XMP/EXIF property-name pool. These are the standard-namespace
fields the application knows by name [UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool]:

| Namespace | Fields |
|---|---|
| `exif:` | `DateTimeOriginal`, `FocalLength`, `FocalLengthIn35mmFilm`, `FocalPlaneResolutionUnit`, `FocalPlaneXResolution`, `FocalPlaneYResolution`, `GPSAltitude`, `GPSAltitudeRef`, `GPSLatitude`, `GPSLongitude`, `PixelXDimension`, `PixelYDimension` |
| `tiff:` | `Make`, `Model`, `Orientation` |
| `aux:` | `Lens`, `SerialNumber` |
| `xmp:` | `CreateDate`, `CreatorTool`, `MetadataDate`, `ModifyDate` |

`tiff:Make` + `tiff:Model` are what `sensorsdb.xml` matches on; `aux:Lens` is the "camera
lens model" the camera DB uses for per-lens-body entries (§13.4). The Help says a camera
DB entry is unnecessary when the image "stores the 35mm equivalent focal length … (e.g.
EXIF or XMP)" [OFFICIAL: appbasics/cameradb] but never names the tag; `FocalLengthIn35mmFilm`
is the only 35 mm-equivalent field in the pool, so that is the one.
[INFERRED, from the pool + the Help]

Encoding split, for anyone re-deriving this: the `exif:`, `tiff:Make`, `tiff:Model` and
`aux:` names are UTF-16LE; `tiff:Orientation` and all four `xmp:` names are single-byte
ASCII. A scan of one encoding only will miss half the table.
[UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool, 2026-08-04]

### 12.2 Focal-length resolution order

[OFFICIAL: appbasics/cameradb, paraphrased]

1. If the image carries a **35 mm-equivalent focal length** (EXIF or XMP), it is read
   directly and no database entry is needed.
2. If the image carries a focal length relative to its chip size **and** a chip size, the
   35 mm equivalent is computed without a database entry.
3. Otherwise the **camera database** is consulted by camera model (plus lens model and
   focal length) to supply `ccdWidth` and lens priors.
4. If none of the above resolves, the 1Ds panel shows a **yellow exclamation mark** next to
   the image — "the system has incomplete camera information".

For this rig, step 1–3 all fail: the WCA JPGs carry `Make`/`Model` and exposure data but
**no focal length and no lens tag**, and the model string does not match any DB entry.
[VERIFIED-by-inspection: docs/settings-evaluation-2026-07 §1]

### 12.3 GPS EXIF

| Control | Key | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ignore exif GPS (global) | `appIgnoreExifGPS` | `false` | globally turn EXIF GPS coordinates on/off |
| Ignore exif GPS (per camera) | `sensorsdb.xml` attribute `GPSMode="ignore"` | per entry | same, scoped to one camera model |

[OFFICIAL: tutorials/setkeyvaluetable, appbasics/appsettings, appbasics/cameradb]

In the shipped `sensorsdb.xml`, `GPSMode="ignore"` appears on **exactly 13** of the 785
entries, all of them Apple iPhone models (`Apple iPhone 3GS`, `4`, `4s`, `4S`, `5`, `5s`,
`5S`, `6s`, `6S`, `6s Plus`, `6S Plus`, `7 Plus`, `X`); `ignore` is the only value present
in the shipped file, and it is also a standalone string in the DB parser's token run. The
binary also contains the attribute name `GPSAccuracy`, which no shipped entry uses.
[VERIFIED-by-inspection of the shipped file + binary, 2026-08-04]
[UNDOCUMENTED: `GPSAccuracy`]

XMP sidecars are one of the four documented routes for georeferencing a scene: "ground
control points, or directly to the camera using the camera priors, flight logs, or XMP
files". To use **EXIF GPS** as camera priors you must "enable the camera priors for
georeferencing in the alignment settings … for the EXIF data to be used".
[OFFICIAL: tutorials/georeferencing] That setting is `sfmEnableCameraPrior=true`.
[VERIFIED: docs/settings-evaluation-2026-07 §4/§5]

**On export, "Replace GPS Exif with optimized values" (`xmpExGps`) writes the
alignment-computed coordinates instead of the EXIF ones.** [OFFICIAL: tools/xmpalign]
The repo's (unused) preset sets it `true`. Note that in this pipeline the exported
`xcr:latitude`/`longitude`/`altitude` were observed to be garbage while `xcr:Position` in
the local frame was correct (§5.2) — so do not trust the geographic fields on this
evidence. [VERIFIED: poses2flightlog.py, zone_9]

### 12.4 EXIF vs XMP precedence

The application setting **"Prefer Exif over XMP"** exists: "When importing new files, Exif
metadata takes priority over XMP metadata if this setting is enabled."
[OFFICIAL: appbasics/appsettings] Its key is **not** in the published
`setkeyvaluetable` list, and the Help never names one.

The binary contains `AppPreferExif` (UTF-16LE, one occurrence) inside a capital-`App`
run — `… AppGroupCalibrationsExif | AppForceEqualCalibration | AppIgnoreExifGPS |
AppPreferExif` — which is a **separate naming family** from the documented lowercase
`-set` keys: `appIgnoreExifGPS` and `appGroupCalibrationByExif` both exist lowercase
elsewhere in the binary and are the forms `setkeyvaluetable` publishes, and note
`AppGroupCalibrationsExif` ≠ `appGroupCalibrationByExif`. Lowercase `appPreferExif` occurs
**zero** times. [UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool, 2026-08-04] So the settable
key, if there is one, is as likely `appPreferExif` (never observed, matching the
documented convention) as `AppPreferExif` (observed, matching the internal convention);
a probe must try both. [OPEN — Q17]

This matters for any XMP-prior pipeline: if the setting is on and the images carry EXIF
focal data, the sidecar's `FocalLength35mm` may be overridden.

### 12.5 The metadata cache

`appCacheImageMetadata` (bool, **default `true`**) — "Cache image metadata" writes a hidden
system file with EXIF-derived metadata (resolution and so on) next to input images, to
speed up access. [OFFICIAL: tutorials/setkeyvaluetable, appbasics/appsettings — the latter
names the file `crmeta.db`] The binary contains the format strings for **both**
`%srsmeta.db` and `%scrmeta.db`, adjacent and in that order, so the 2.2-era filename is
likely `rsmeta.db` with `crmeta.db` retained for legacy trees.
[UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool] Related and undocumented: the cache **location**
is `appCacheLocation` with enum `SystemTemp` \| `ProjectFolder` \| `Custom`.
[UNDOCUMENTED: binary]

Operational note: these files appear inside image directories and will be swept up by any
naive "copy the image folder" step. They are not sidecars and carry no priors.

### 12.6 This pipeline reads no EXIF at all

`modules/file_metadata_parser.py` derives timestamps from **filenames**, not EXIF:
`(?:camlower_|cammid_|camupper_)?(\d{8}T\d{6}Z|\d{14})`, defaulting to
`19700101T000000Z` when nothing matches. Frame numbers come from `frame(\d+)`.
[VERIFIED-by-inspection: modules/file_metadata_parser.py]

Full-file image verification is untenable at scale here — PIL `.verify()` walks every byte,

other 8,196 are **4244×2827**. A different sensor footprint means different intrinsics, so
RealityScan will group it separately **regardless of its XMP calibration group**.

## 13. The sensor database `sensorsdb.xml`

### 13.1 Location and the actual state of this machine

| Path | Role |

| `C:\ProgramData\Epic\RealityScan\sensorsdb.xml` | **the file the application reads** [OFFICIAL: appbasics/cameradb] |
| `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\RealityScan_2.2\sensorsdb.xml` | install-tree copy |
| `<repo>\sensorsdb.xml` | this project's modified copy |

Measured 2026-08-04: the ProgramData file and the install-tree file are **byte-identical**
(SHA-256 `FA3D6EED…BAC01A37`, 47,925 bytes, 785 `<camera>` entries). The repo's copy is
48,580 bytes and prepends four hand-authored ROV entries that are **not present on this
machine**:

```xml
<camera model="ZCAM F6 8-15mm Fisheye Upper" ccdWidth="37.09"><lens type="division" focal="13"   c1="0"/></camera>
<camera model="ZCAM F6 8-15mm Fisheye Mid"   ccdWidth="37.09"><lens type="division" focal="13.5" c1="0"/></camera>

[VERIFIED-by-inspection, 2026-08-04] Those entries are inert for two independent reasons:
they are not installed, and their `model` strings cannot match this rig's EXIF
(`Make="Z CAM"`, `Model="E2-F6"`) anyway. The database also **cannot distinguish two
cameras with identical EXIF**, which is the rig's actual problem.

Note the same install-tree/ProgramData duality applies to `flightlogs.xml`, which **was**
hand-edited in Program Files to add a 13-column format; that edit must be re-checked after
any app update. See `06-georeferencing-flightlogs-and-scale.md`.

### 13.2 Schema

```xml
<cameras>
  <camera model="Apple iPhone 5s" ccdWidth="4.8900" GPSMode="ignore"/>
  <camera model="Gopro HD3"><lens type="division" focal="15" c1="-0.3143"/></camera>
</cameras>
```

| Element / attribute | Meaning | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `<cameras>` … `</cameras>` | root | shipped file + binary parser strings |
| `<camera model="…">` | one entry; `model` matches the camera model string RealityScan displays in the 1D/1Ds panels (from `tiff:Make` + `tiff:Model`) | [OFFICIAL: appbasics/cameradb] |
| `ccdWidth="…"` | sensor width in mm — supplies the missing chip size so a 35 mm equivalent can be computed. **"Define a ccdWidth to get rid of the yellow exclamation mark."** | [OFFICIAL: appbasics/cameradb] |
| `GPSMode="ignore"` | per-camera EXIF GPS suppression | [OFFICIAL: appbasics/cameradb] |
| `GPSAccuracy="…"` | present in the parser's string pool; unused by any shipped entry | [UNDOCUMENTED: binary] |
| `orientationAccuracy="…"` | present in the parser's string pool; unused by any shipped entry | [UNDOCUMENTED: binary] |
| `<lens type="…" focal="…" c1="…"/>` | lens prior for a given focal length; multiple `<lens>` elements per camera define different focal lengths | [OFFICIAL: appbasics/cameradb] + shipped file |
| `<lens … quality="exact"/>` | makes it a **hard** prior — the system will not change the value. Recommended for fixed setups. Without it, DB priors are **soft**: RealityScan optimises them. | [OFFICIAL: appbasics/cameradb] |
| `focus="…"`, `distance="…"` | present in the parser's string pool; not in any shipped entry and not documented | [UNDOCUMENTED: binary] |

The DB parser's own contiguous ASCII token run is, verbatim in order:
`cameras | ignore | /cameras | GPSAccuracy | ccdWidth | brownr4t2 | brownr4 |
orientationAccuracy | /camera | GPSMode | brownr3 | lens | brownr3t2 | brown | focus |
/lens | distance`. So the `type` vocabulary it carries is `brown`, `brownr3`, `brownr3t2`,
`brownr4`, `brownr4t2` — note these are the DB's **own** spellings, distinct from both the
XMP tokens and the `sfmDistortionModel` names (§4.3). `division` is not in that run (it is
in the XMP value pool) yet is the value both shipped `<lens>` entries use, so it is
certainly accepted. [UNDOCUMENTED: RealityScan.exe string pool + shipped file inspection,
2026-08-04] Note also what is **absent** from the run: no `model`, `focal`, `c1` or
`quality` — those are stored differently and were not recoverable this way, but all four
are documented or present in the shipped file.

Shipped content census, 2026-08-04: **785 camera entries, of which exactly 2 carry a
`<lens>` prior** — `Gopro HD3` and `GoPro Hero3-Black Edition`, both
`type="division" focal="15" c1="-0.3143"`. Everything else is a bare `ccdWidth`
(+ sometimes `GPSMode="ignore"`). [VERIFIED-by-inspection, 2026-08-04]

### 13.3 When to add an entry

[OFFICIAL: appbasics/cameradb]

- The image files carry a focal length that is **not** the 35 mm equivalent (e.g. relative
  to chip size).
- Lens distortion is **directly noticeable** in the input images — priors help register
  more precisely.
- A **yellow exclamation mark** appears in the 1Ds panel next to an image.

It is explicitly *not* necessary to add every camera. Epic's own caution: add or modify
entries only "if you know what you are doing", in a controlled environment.

### 13.4 The documented procedure for a high-distortion lens

[OFFICIAL: appbasics/cameradb, condensed]

1. Photograph a heavily-textured object (a box covered in newspaper) and load the images
   into a new project.
2. Set **Prior lens distortion / Prior = Unknown**, since great distortion is expected.
3. **Group** the cameras (Inputs panel → Group) so the scene is better conditioned.
4. Select the **Division** model (ALIGNMENT → Settings → Advanced → Distortion model) —
   one parameter to estimate. For *hard* (exact-quality) priors, use a richer model
   instead: Brown3, Brown4, Brown3 with tangential2, or Brown4 with tangential2.
5. Align (F6).
6. Read the solved optics: focal and λ in a 2Ds image view, or 1Ds/2Ds/1D panel →
   Registration → Calibration.
7. Add an entry to `C:\ProgramData\Epic\RealityScan\sensorsdb.xml` with the camera model
   name plus the `focal` and `c1` from step 6. Save.

From then on the system sets those camera priors automatically.

Additional documented behaviours:

- **Per-lens-body entries.** The system matches on **camera model + camera lens model +
  focal length**, so cameras with interchangeable lenses can have distinct priors. The
  lens model is readable in the 1D/1Ds view when an image is selected (it is `aux:Lens`).
- **Interpolation.** If an image with the same camera and lens model but a *different*
  focal length is imported, RealityScan **automatically computes** the distortion values
  from the other data available in the database.
- **Soft by default.** DB priors are soft — the system optimises them, so a rough estimate
  suffices and a single-parameter division model is a very good choice. Add
  `quality="exact"` to the `<lens>` attributes for hard priors.

### 13.5 Precedence relative to XMP

Not documented. Where an image has both a `sensorsdb.xml` match and an XMP sidecar
carrying `FocalLength35mm` / `DistortionModel`, which wins is unstated in the Help and
untested here. The only adjacent documented control is "Prefer Exif over XMP" (§12.4),
which governs EXIF vs XMP, not DB vs XMP. [OPEN — Q18]

## 14. Undistortion and registration-export interactions

XMP export from the Registration-export route can write **undistorted** values and images.
The pipeline, in the order the application applies it [OFFICIAL: tools/undistort]:

1. **Image cut-out** — which fraction of the image is considered for undistortion.
   `1.0` = full image, `0.5` = 50 %, `0` = nothing. **For fish-eye lenses Epic recommends
   0.8.**
2. **Fit** — which section of the undistorted image is output: `Outer boundary`,
   `Inner region`, `In between`, or `Keep intrinsics` (preserves the camera calibration
   parameters).
3. **Resolution** — `Fit` (keep the resolution from step 2), `Preserve` (same as the
   original image), or `Custom` (arbitrary width/height).
4. **Downscale** — integer divisor applied to each side. `1` = no change.
5. **Max count of pixels** — `0` = no limit; otherwise the aspect ratio from the previous
   steps is preserved and the image resampled to fit that pixel budget.
6. **Undistort principal point** — `1` shifts the optical centre to the actual centre of
   the exported image; `0` = no shift.

Relevant CLI commands [OFFICIAL: appbasics/allcommands]:

| Command | Parameters | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `-exportUndistortedImages` | `folderName` required, `params.xml` optional | falls back to "the current settings" |
| `-exportSTMap` | **both** `folderName` and `params.xml` optional | "If folderName and params.xml are not specified, results are stored along with the original images using the current settings" |

**Spelling trap.** `appbasics/allcommands.htm` writes `exportUndistortedImages`;
`tutorials/commandline_1.htm` writes `exportUndistoredImages` (no `t`) for the same row.
Only one can be the accepted switch and neither has been tried here — the correctly spelled
form is the one on the canonical command page.
[CONTRADICTED: two Help pages disagree on the command's spelling, verified by grep over
`Help\en-US\*\*.htm`, 2026-08-04] [OPEN — Q19]

## 16. Runnable recipes

### 16.1 Write calibration-only sidecars for a batched zone tree

**Must be one physical line.** cmd's `^` line-continuation is inert *inside* a quoted
string — the caret is passed through to Python verbatim and yields
`SyntaxError: invalid syntax`. Verified by execution, 2026-08-04.

```bat
py -3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, r'C:\Users\jonat\Desktop\CoyoteThings\wildscan'); from modules import camera_registry as cr; print(cr.ensure_calibration_sidecars(r'F:\na156_h2024\batched_images_by_zone\zone_1'))"
```

Prints `(created, unknown_camera_skipped)`. Idempotent: images that already have a sidecar
are skipped, so this is safe to run before every align. Note it walks with `os.walk`, so
unlike the PowerShell harvest it **does** cross directory junctions in both directions
(§1.1) — which is why it reported correct coverage throughout the reparse-point incident
and raised no warning. [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-27]

### 16.2 The canonical per-zone align + identity harvest

Abbreviated from `RS_CLI/Scripts/AlignZone.bat`. Every operation goes through the shared
`:run` subroutine (`-delegateTo` → grace → `-waitCompleted` → grace → `-waitCompleted` →
abort if `RS_CLI/Errors/errors.txt` is non-empty); see `01-cli-fundamentals.md`.

```bat
call :run -newScene                                        || goto :fail
:: -set is INSTANT and FIFO-ordered ahead of the queued -addFolder, so it is
:: fired directly, NOT through :run (no completion to wait for). Inside a .bat
:: the "key=value" form is correct; the repo's "key:value" convention exists
:: only for settings crossing a Python -> cmd argument boundary (see 01-...).
%RealityScan% -delegateTo %RS_INSTANCE% -set "appIncSubdirs=true"
call :run -addFolder "%input_dir%"                         || goto :fail
call :run -importFlightLog "%flight_log_dir%" "%flight_log_params_dir%" || goto :fail
:: sfm*/lis* keys parsed out of AlignmentParams.xml and pushed one -set at a
:: time, also fired directly for the same reason
call :run -align                                           || goto :fail
call :run -deselectAllImages                               || goto :fail
call :run -setMinComponentSize %min_component_size%        || goto :fail
call :run -save "%output_dir%\%scene_name%.rsproj"         || goto :fail

:: destructive in-memory identity loop; the scene is already saved
set /a comp_index=0
:identityLoop
if %comp_index% GEQ 20 goto :identityDone
if not exist "%output_dir%\identity_r%comp_index%" mkdir "%output_dir%\identity_r%comp_index%"
call :run -deselectAllImages                               || goto :fail
call :run -exportXMP                                       || goto :fail
powershell -NoProfile -Command "Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath '%input_dir%' -Recurse -Filter *.xmp | Where-Object { Select-String -LiteralPath $_.FullName -Pattern 'xcr:Position' -Quiet } | Move-Item -Destination '%output_dir%\identity_r%comp_index%' -Force"
set "have_poses="
for %%F in ("%output_dir%\identity_r%comp_index%\*.xmp") do set have_poses=1
if not defined have_poses goto :identityDone
call :run -selectMaximalComponent                          || goto :fail
call :run -renameSelectedComponent "%scene_name%_c%comp_index%" || goto :fail
call :run -exportSelectedComponentDir "%output_dir%"       || goto :fail
if not exist "%output_dir%\%scene_name%_c%comp_index%.rsalign" goto :identityDone
call :run -deleteSelectedComponent                         || goto :fail
set /a comp_index+=1
goto :identityLoop
:identityDone
%RealityScan% -delegateTo %RS_INSTANCE% -quit
```

The loop terminal is a **file-existence check**, not an error check:
`-selectMaximalComponent`, `-renameSelectedComponent` and `-deleteSelectedComponent` all
silently no-op on an empty scene, and there is no CLI query for "how many components
remain". [VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-23/24]

### 16.3 Census then sanitise (order matters)

Again one physical line (see §16.1):

```bat
py -3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, r'C:\Users\jonat\Desktop\CoyoteThings\wildscan'); from modules import camera_registry as cr; root=r'F:\na156_h2024\batched_images_by_zone\zone_1'; print('pose_count, restored, removed =', cr.sanitize_and_census(root)); print('created, unknown =', cr.ensure_calibration_sidecars(root))"
```

`sanitize_and_census` returns the registration census **and** destroys the evidence in the
same call — read the return value; there is no second chance.

### 16.4 Prove a prior actually landed

There is no CLI query for an image's current priors. The only headless read-back is to
align and export:

```bat
RealityScan.exe -setInstanceName RS1 -headless -silent "D:\rs\errors" ^
  -set "appIncSubdirs=true" -add "D:\probe\probe.imagelist" -align ^
  -deselectAllImages -setMinComponentSize 1 -exportXMP -quit
```

then read `xcr:FocalLength35mm`, `xcr:DistortionModel`, `xcr:CalibrationGroup` out of the
resulting `<stem>.xmp` files. This is the mechanism every probe in
[Open questions](#open-questions) uses.

## Open questions

Every [OPEN] item raised above, with the cheapest experiment that closes it. None of these
have been run.

| # | Question | Cheapest probe |
|---|---|---|
| **Q1** | When both `_common.xmp` and `<stem>.xmp` exist in a folder, which wins — and do they merge per-field? | Smoke fixture (120 images, ~2 min align). `_common.xmp` with `FocalLength35mm=20`, one image's `<stem>.xmp` with `FocalLength35mm=30`. Align, `-exportXMP`, read that image's solved focal against its neighbours. |
| **Q2** | Does `_common.xmp` apply recursively to subfolders, or only to its own folder? | Same fixture with per-camera subfolders; place `_common.xmp` at the zone root only, align, and check whether cameras in `cinema\` and `port\` both received the group. |
| **Q3** | What does `-addImageWithCalibration` cost per image at 8k scale, and does it accept delegation? | Time 100 delegated `-addImageWithCalibration` calls on the smoke fixture; extrapolate. ~3 min. |
| **Q4** | Does the XMP reader accept **element** form for attributes other than `Position`? | Two sidecars for one image on the smoke fixture, one attribute-form and one element-form, differing only in `FocalLength35mm`. Align each, compare exported solved focal. ~5 min. |
| ~~Q5~~ | ~~What is `xcr:Cert`?~~ | **CLOSED 2026-08-04.** It is the licence-certificate element `<xcr:Cert id="%s">` inside `<certificates>`, not an image-sidecar attribute (§3). Settled from the binary's string neighbourhood — `importLicense`, `exportLicense`, `"certificate file"`, `certificates\`. No probe needed. |
| **Q6** | Are the XMP prior tokens exactly `{initial, exact, locked}`, and does an unrecognised value (e.g. `Approximate`) fail loudly or silently? | Smoke fixture; one sidecar with `xcr:CalibrationPrior="Approximate"` and one with `"initial"`, both with `FocalLength35mm` far from truth. Compare solved focals and grep `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\RealityScan.log` for the literals **`Skipping unexpected attribute`** and **`Skipping unexpected tag`** — both are format strings in the binary (`Skipping unexpected attribute, %s=%S`), so if the XMP reader shares the app's XML diagnostics they are the loudest signal available. Caveat: they were found in the **project-XML** parser's string neighbourhood, so their firing on a sidecar is not guaranteed. ~5 min. |
| **Q7** | **Narrowed 2026-08-04.** The *native* six-slot order is `k1 k2 k3 k4 t1 t2` — two shipped `calibration.xml` templates emit it literally (§4.3a). What remains open is only whether `xcr:DistortionCoeficients` uses that same order. | Align the smoke fixture under `Brown3WithTangential2` (so `t1 ≠ t2 ≠ 0`), `-exportXMP`, and cross-read the same cameras through `-exportRegistration` in the **Internal/External Camera Parameters** format (`{0CA18733-…}`, header `…,k1,k2,k3,k4,t1,t2`). Requires a GUI-exported registration params XML first — see Q20. |
| **Q8** | **Narrowed 2026-08-04.** The Help's GUI label says "[mm]"; the shipped `{0CA18733-…}` template names the same quantity `px_norm`/`py_norm` and writes `$(px)` raw beside `f_35mm = $(f*36)` (§4.4). Treat as normalised. What remains open is the exact divisor — image width, or the larger image dimension. | One camera, cross-read: `px_norm` from `{0CA18733-…}` and `px_pix` from the OpenCV format `{B5331837-…}` (`px*scale+width*0.5`). `scale = (px_pix − width/2) / px_norm` settles the divisor arithmetically. Blocked on Q20. |
| **Q9** | `xcr:Rotation` convention: row-major? world→camera? handedness? — the export variables `R00…R22` are settled (row-major, world→camera; the CmpMvs template builds `P = K·[R|t]`, §5.1), but `xcr:Rotation` is a different serialiser. | Same cross-read: compare one camera's nine `xcr:Rotation` floats against its `R00…R22` from `{0CA18733-…}` or Boujou. Decisive, needs no new alignment. Blocked on Q20. |
| **Q10** | Is `xcr:Position` UTM in a scene georeferenced **before** export, or always local? | Hardening cell U13: export XMP in an original georeferenced zone scene and compare positions to the flight-log UTM. ~5 min on zone_3 (124 images). Also read `xcr:ExportCoordinateSystemType` from the same files. |
| **Q11** | **Largely answered 2026-08-04: the key is `inpAspect`**, found in the binary's `inp*` pool between `inpPPX` and `inpSkew` (§6.6); the Help's duplicate `inpSkew` row is a copy-paste error. What remains is only whether `-editInputSelection` *accepts* it. | `-editInputSelection "inpAspect=1.5"` on a selected image, then check `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\RealityScan.log` for `err:7155` ("Parsing setting … failed"). Seconds; no align needed. Confirm positively with an align + `-exportXMP` read of `xcr:AspectRatio`. |
| **Q12** | Does Epic's ungroup-and-re-align refinement (group → align → ungroup → align) improve this rig? | Z3 fixture (124 images, ~4 min/align): align grouped, then `-removeCalibrationGroups` + `-align`, compare registration, component count and solved focal spread. ~10 min total. |
| **Q13** | **Does the repo's `Camera:`-namespaced element-form sidecar do anything at all?** Also settles §7.5's attribution: cell (c) declaring `xcr:DistortionModel="brown3"` under a global `sfmDistortionModel=Division` distinguishes "the global key wins" from "the repo's sidecar was never parsed". | Z3 fixture (124 images, ~4 min/align), three cells, one variable each: (a) no sidecars, (b) current repo-form sidecars, (c) documented attribute form under `.../ns/xcr/1.1#` with `xcr:CalibrationPrior="initial"`, `xcr:CalibrationGroup`, `xcr:DistortionGroup`, `xcr:FocalLength35mm`, `xcr:DistortionModel`. Compare registration, component count, the exported `xcr:DistortionModel`, and the **spread** of solved focal within each camera (a real group forces one focal; ungrouped self-calibration does not — the ±0.5 % IQR of §7.4 is the number to beat). Grep each run's `RealityScan.log` snapshot for `Skipping unexpected attribute` / `Skipping unexpected tag`. ~15 min total. **Highest-value probe in this document.** |
| **Q14** | Is the 3,740→3,738 fusion deficit a real solver drop or a harvest artifact? | Re-import `cluster_*_m_c0.rsalign` **from its original export location** into a spare instance and census it: 3,740 means accounting artifact, 3,738 means real loss. Uses artifacts already on disk. (Reading the count from `rslog.txt` is **not** trustworthy on these artifacts — see the log-splice finding in `01-cli-fundamentals.md`.) |
| **Q15** | What do the `xmpCamera` integers mean, and what does the default (unpinned) export mode write? | Export XMP three times from the smoke fixture with `xmpCamera` 1/2/3 in a params XML, and once with no params; read `xcr:PosePrior` from the results. ~4 min. Settles Q16 as a side effect. |
| **Q16** | What `xcr:PosePrior` value does this pipeline's production export actually write — and therefore how hard is the contamination in §10? | Covered by Q15's "no params" cell; or simply grep any existing `identity_r*` directory on the data drives for `PosePrior`. Zero cost if those artifacts still exist. |
| **Q17** | Is "Prefer Exif over XMP" settable from the CLI, under which spelling, and what is its default? The binary has `AppPreferExif` (capital `A`, matching an internal family) but not `appPreferExif` (lowercase, matching every documented `-set` key). | Boot once with both: `-set "AppPreferExif=false" -set "appPreferExif=false"`, then read `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\RealityScan.log` for `err:7155` — whichever spelling does **not** produce a parse failure is the key. Seconds. Snapshot the log immediately: the next boot destroys it (NA167 B6). |
| **Q18** | Precedence between a `sensorsdb.xml` entry and an XMP sidecar for the same image | Add a DB entry for the smoke fixture's camera model with a deliberately wrong `focal`, plus a sidecar with the right one; align and read the solved value. ~5 min plus a ProgramData edit (back the file up first). |
| **Q19** | Does `-exportUndistortedImages` / `-exportSTMap` work headless, and at what cost — and which spelling of the undistort command does the parser accept (`exportUndistortedImages` per `allcommands` vs `exportUndistoredImages` per `commandline_1`, §14)? | The spelling half is free: issue both at boot on an empty scene and read `RealityScan.log` — an unknown command is reported, a known one is not. The functional half is blocked on Q20 (`-exportSTMap` alone may run with no params at all, since the Help says both of its arguments are optional). |
| **Q20** | Obtain a valid Export Registration params XML | One GUI session: open any aligned project, Export Registration → "RealityScan XMPs with Image List" → configure → save the params. Unblocks Q7, Q8, Q9, Q19 and makes `-exportRegistration` usable headless at all. **Cheapest single action with the widest unblocking effect in this document.** |
