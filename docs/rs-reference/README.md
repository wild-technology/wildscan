# RealityScan 2.2 CLI reference — index

A complete reference for driving **RealityScan 2.2** (Epic Games; the product formerly named
RealityCapture) from its **command line**, headless, unattended.

It fuses two sources that do not otherwise exist in one place:

1. **Epic's shipped documentation** — the complete offline Help
   (`C:\Program Files\Epic Games\RealityScan_2.2\Help\en-US\`), plus the XML schema and format
   dictionaries shipped in the install tree (`flightlogs.xml`, `sensorsdb.xml`, `epsg.xml`,
   `calibration.xml`, `Settings\SimplifiedExport\*.xml`, …).
2. **The empirical record of this repository** — two years of production use driving RealityScan
   headless over ROV underwater photogrammetry at 8,000+ camera scale: `FINDINGS.md`,
   `testing/NA167_SESSION_NOTES.md` (bugs B1–B11), the test plans in `testing/`, `docs/*.md`, and
   the working code in `modules/realityscan_interface/`.

**Where the two disagree, both are recorded.** The documented claim, the observed behavior, and
how the observation was made are all stated, and the entry is tagged `[CONTRADICTED]`. Those
entries are the highest-value content in this set; none of them has been smoothed over. The tag
appears **168** times across the thirteen documents (occurrences, including cross-references to a
contradiction documented in full elsewhere).

Every document is self-contained enough to answer a question without loading its siblings, and
cross-references siblings by exact filename when the full treatment lives elsewhere.

## Provenance tags

Every non-obvious claim in this reference carries exactly one tag.

| Tag | Meaning | Citation form |
|---|---|---|
| `[OFFICIAL]` | Stated by the shipped Help / Epic docs | `[OFFICIAL: appbasics/allcommands]` — the Help topic path |
| `[VERIFIED]` | Established empirically in this repository | `[VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-23]`, `[VERIFIED: NA167 B5]` |
| `[CONTRADICTED]` | Docs say X, observation says Y — **both** stated, with how Y was observed | `[CONTRADICTED: NA167 D1/D2, 2026-07-24]` |
| `[UNDOCUMENTED]` | True behavior with no Help coverage at all; the entry says how it is known | `[UNDOCUMENTED: binary string extraction]` |
| `[INFERRED]` | Reasoned, not tested. The entry says what would settle it | `[INFERRED: absence of the literal string implies …]` |
| `[OPEN]` | Known unknown: the question plus the cheapest probe that answers it | `[OPEN, §18-Q9]` |

Compound forms appear where they carry information: `[SUPERSEDED]` marks a refuted claim that is
**retained** (deleting it guarantees rediscovering it), `[VERIFIED-as-decision]` marks a policy
choice rather than a measurement, `[VERIFIED-by-inspection]` marks a fact read off a file rather
than produced by a run.

**Aggregation rule: a claim built out of tagged facts keeps the WEAKEST tag.** A mean over
`[INFERRED]` values is `[INFERRED]`. A conclusion that chains one `[VERIFIED]` measurement to one
`[INFERRED]` step is `[INFERRED]`. Do not upgrade a tag because the claim sounds right.

Tag census across the thirteen documents (occurrences, not unique facts):

| `[OFFICIAL]` | `[VERIFIED]` | `[CONTRADICTED]` | `[UNDOCUMENTED]` | `[INFERRED]` | `[OPEN]` | `[SUPERSEDED]` |

## Document map

One hop per question. Pick the row whose trigger matches, read that file.

| # | File | Read this when… |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | `01-cli-fundamentals.md` | You need to *start* RealityScan and keep control of it: executable discovery, command-line grammar and quoting, startup switches, `-headless` vs `-hideUI`, named instances, `-delegateTo`, the `-waitCompleted` / `-getStatus` contract, verified shutdown, the `-writeProgress` file format, the `appProcessAction` completion hook, exit/result codes, `RealityScan.log`, licensing, multi-GPU pinning, cache/disk behavior. |
| 02 | `02-command-reference.md` | You need the exact spelling, parameters, process ID and real behavior of **any** command. All 218 command names, grouped as the Help groups them, plus commands that do **not** exist, Help-prose-only and typo spellings, one command hidden inside an HTML comment in the Help source (`-undercut`), deprecated commands, commands unusable under delegation, and an alphabetical index. |
| 03 | `03-settings-keys.md` | You need a `-set` / `-preset` key: its type, default, allowed values, whether it needs a restart, whether it is dead or inert. 740 keys across four tiers, plus the quoting mechanics, the persistence rules, and the keys this pipeline pins in production and why. |
| 04 | `04-image-input-and-handling.md` | You are getting images *into* a scene or selecting them: `-add`, `.imagelist`, `-addFolder` + `appIncSubdirs`, video/LiDAR/HDR/BLK3D import, image **identity is path identity**, selection commands, per-image controls, calibration and lens groups, image layers, masks, depth/normal/mask export, preprocessing (CLAHE) before import, copies vs hardlinks vs junctions. |
| 05 | `05-metadata-xmp-and-sidecars.md` | You are reading or writing XMP sidecars: the `<stem>.xmp` naming contract, `_common.xmp`, the complete `xcr:` attribute set and value enumerations, prior semantics per mode, `-exportXMP` vs `-exportXMPForSelectedComponent` naming, the auto-import trap and the sidecar cleaning protocol, EXIF handling, `sensorsdb.xml`. |
| 06 | `06-georeferencing-flightlogs-and-scale.md` | You are putting real-world position, orientation or **metric scale** into a scene: `-importFlightLog` / `-importTrajectory`, the log format, `flightlogs.xml` reader definitions, `FlightLogParams.xml` field by field, `authority:id` coordinate systems, GCPs, control points, markers, distance constraints, `-update`, scale as an automated acceptance oracle, and **the VERTICAL datum** — why the exported Z is a sea-surface depth and not an ellipsoidal height, and the geoid correction that separates them. |
| 07 | `07-alignment.md` | You are running or tuning alignment: `-align` / `-draft` / `-detectFeatures` / `-update`, every `sfm*` and `lis*` key with its measured effect, `AlignmentParams.xml` field by field, `-editInputSelection` / `inp*` per-image controls, what priors do to a solve, component control during alignment, how to judge a bad solve, and a tuning playbook. |
| 08 | `08-components-and-merge.md` | You are working with components or trying to merge them: what a component is, every component command, the `.rsalign` file, the `.complist` input file, **merge semantics** (what actually fuses, what silently does not), the verification protocol, and merge strategy at 8,000+ camera scale. |
| 09 | `09-xml-parameter-files.md` | You are writing, editing or debugging a `params.xml`: which commands consume one, which silently ignore one, the `<Configuration>` schema per profile type, `.rsortho` / `.rsbox` / `.rsinfo` / `.rcconfig` — including the `.rsInfo` `<Model>` tag and how to decode `transformToModel`, the only on-disk record of what frame an export landed in — the install-tree format dictionaries, the 34 shipped profiles as worked examples, and an authoring guide. |
| 10 | `10-reconstruction-texturing-export.md` | You are downstream of a solved alignment: reconstruction region, mesh quality tiers, depth-map controls, model naming and lifecycle, cleaning/filtering/holes/simplify/smooth, classification and DTM, colorization vs texturing, unwrapping and the texture budget, reprojection, every export command and its profile, LoD/3D Tiles, ortho/DSM/DTM/contours, publishing targets, reports. |
| 11 | `11-automation-patterns.md` | You are building the harness: persistent instances, the canonical `:run` subroutine, the ErrorWriter completion trigger, marker-file ownership, crossing the cmd/`.bat` data boundary, multi-GPU isolation, progress and stall monitoring, checkpoint/rollback, census-based verification, log snapshotting, four end-to-end recipes, and an anti-pattern list. |
| 12 | `12-failure-modes-and-race-conditions.md` | Something failed, hung, or "succeeded" without doing anything. 88 numbered entries `F-01`…`F-88` (symptom → cause → how detected → mitigation → detection test), the complete exit-code / result-code / `err:NNNN` / process-ID tables, the NA167 `B1`–`B11` map, and an ordered diagnostic playbook keyed by symptom. |
| 13 | `13-camera-rigs-priors-and-orientation.md` | You are telling RealityScan where a camera is and which way it points: the prior model, XMP as the per-image channel, `xcr:Rig` / `RigInstance` / `RigPoseIndex`, calibration vs distortion groups, distortion models and their coefficient vectors, rotation conventions, prior strength/accuracy/composition, every coordinate frame in play and the transforms between them, applied to a four-camera underwater ROV rig. |

**Routing shortcuts.**
Command spelling or parameters → 02. Key name, type or default → 03. "Why did it not fail
loudly?" → 12. "How do I build the loop that runs it?" → 11. "What file do I pass as
`params.xml`?" → 09.

## Fast path: the facts that silently destroy a run

Each of these produces a **clean exit status** and no error while doing the wrong thing — or
nothing at all. They are the reason this reference exists. Read the linked section before doing
the thing in column 1.

| If you are about to… | Read | Do NOT | Tag |
|---|---|---|---|
| Publish a georeferenced mesh to Cesium ion | `10-reconstruction-texturing-export.md` §17.2.1 | Do not hand Cesium the exported Z. It is a depth below the **sea surface** (`geoall.py` writes `-abs(kalman_depth)`), while Cesium reads every height as above the **WGS84 ellipsoid**, and the project CRS is 2D so nothing declares which. The asset sinks or floats by the geoid undulation — **+72.69 m** at NA168 H2080, +70.4 m Solomon Sea, −27.1 m Gulf of Mexico. Convert with `h = −depth + N` (`modules/cesium_placement.py`) and confirm by decoding the finished tileset, never by the upload's exit status. ion itself is blameless: it honours a negative height to **−0.000 m** | `[VERIFIED: probe asset 5171554, FINDINGS 2026-08-31]` |
| Compute a geoid correction with PROJ | `10-…` §17.2.1 | Never call `Transformer.from_crs` without `allow_ballpark=False`. With the grid absent PROJ **succeeds and returns Z unchanged**, having silently chosen a "ballpark vertical transformation" — the correction reads as applied and is zero. The EGM2008 grid (`us_nga_egm08_25.tif`, ~80 MB) needs `PROJ_NETWORK=ON` or a local `projsync` | `[VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-08-31]` |
| Conclude that a merge worked | `08-components-and-merge.md` §6; `12-failure-modes-and-race-conditions.md` §1 | Do not read exit status, `errors.txt` emptiness, or "completed" as evidence. `-mergeComponents` exits **SUCCESS** and leaves the components separate under every flag combination when nothing can fuse. The verdict is a **camera census** of the resulting component, never the status | `[VERIFIED: NA167 #23/#26; FINDINGS 2026-07-23/24]` |
| Plan which components will fuse | `08-components-and-merge.md` §5.2 | Do not assume georeference or flags can fuse components with **zero image-content overlap** — nothing does, silently. The governing rule is **content overlap**, not path identity: shared camera paths are *sufficient but not necessary* (probe D7 fused two components with zero shared basenames and zero shared paths). The older "components fuse only through shared image identity" rule is retained as `[SUPERSEDED]`, not deleted. `sfmMergeGeoreferencedComponents=true`, whose documented purpose is exactly overlap-free merging, has **never** been observed to work headless | `[VERIFIED: D7 probe wave 2026-07-24]` + `[CONTRADICTED: NA167 D1/D2]` |
| Run `-importComponent` | `08-components-and-merge.md` §3.3; `12-…` `F-36` | Never import a `.rsalign` from anywhere except its **original export location**. A relocated copy does not fail — it hangs the instance permanently in `#timeout` (≥6 h observed, no error, no minidump). Pass a `.complist` of in-place paths | `[VERIFIED: NA167 B1]` `[UNDOCUMENTED]` |
| Pass alignment settings to `-align` | `07-alignment.md` §2 | `-align` takes **no parameters** in 2.x. A `params.xml` argument is accepted on the command line and **silently ignored**. Push every `sfm*` / `lis*` key through `-set "key=value"` *before* the align | `[VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-21]` |
| Trust that a flight log's orientation priors arrived | `06-georeferencing-flightlogs-and-scale.md` §2.3 | Do not assume `gpsLogFileFormat` resolved. If that GUID is **not present in the installed `flightlogs.xml`**, RealityScan imports **position only**, drops every orientation and accuracy column, and still returns **exit code 0** with no warning. Check the saved `.rsproj`: `absPrior="registered"` and missing `absu*` means the format did not resolve; `absPrior="pose"` with `absu*` present means it did. Verify the params GUID and the installed GUID **match each other** | `[VERIFIED: onr2 fixture 2026-08-23]` |
| Put `FocalLength` in a flight log | `06-…` §2.4 | It is in the documented variable vocabulary, imports without error, and is **never stored** — no `FocalLength35mm` / `FocalPrior` reaches the project and the solve ignores it. Per-image intrinsics must go through XMP sidecars | `[CONTRADICTED: onr2 2026-08-23]` |
| Declare a camera rig via `xcr:Rig` in XMP | `13-camera-rigs-priors-and-orientation.md` §3.5 | The documented sidecar attributes are **not sufficient**. `-add` then demands `rig<GUID>.rcrx` beside the images and the run dies (`0 registered`). No `.rcrx` ships and the extension is in no Help topic. To transport an external solve, supply **poses** instead and omit `xcr:Rig` entirely | `[VERIFIED: onr2 2026-08-23, 2/2]` |
| Attribute an alignment difference to a setting | `13-…` §4.4 | Do not, without a replicate. Bit-identical reruns on marginal geometry gave **26 vs 55** and **76 vs 61** registered; that within-configuration spread covered a third to a half of the range across thirteen different configurations. `-align` exposes no seed. Run one repeat **before** ranking anything | `[VERIFIED: onr2 2026-08-23]` |
| Parse `xcr:Rotation` out of a sidecar | `05-metadata-xmp-and-sidecars.md` §2.3 | Do not match the attribute form only. RealityScan 2.2 writes **both** `Position` and `Rotation` as child **elements** (`xcr:Version="4"`), whereas Epic's sample writes `Rotation` as an **attribute** (and older exports wrote `Position` as one). Match both forms for both, or read zero rotations silently | `[CONTRADICTED: onr2 2026-08-23]` |
| Pass a `key=value` through a `.bat` | `11-automation-patterns.md` §5; `03-settings-keys.md` §1.2 | Never pass unquoted delimited data (`=` `;` `,`) as a `.bat` argument: cmd splits it, Python `subprocess` only quotes on whitespace, and RealityScan logs `err:7155 Parsing setting … failed` while applying **nothing**. Quote the whole pair (`-set "key=value"`); cross the `.bat` boundary as `key:value` and convert inside the workflow; cross list data as a **file** (`.complist` / `.imagelist`) | `[VERIFIED: NA167 B5]` |
| Write a calibration or pose sidecar | `05-metadata-xmp-and-sidecars.md` §1.1 | Never name it `image.jpg.xmp`. RealityScan binds `<stem>.xmp` **in the same folder** and ignores anything else **silently** — no warning, no log line, no code. Every calibration prior this repo wrote before 2026-07-22 was never loaded. Invariant to check: `count(*.xmp) == count(images)` | `[VERIFIED: NA167 B7]` |
| Start a run that must be prior-free | `05-metadata-xmp-and-sidecars.md` §10 | Do not leave old sidecars beside the images. `-add` / `-addFolder` **auto-import `<stem>.xmp` as pose and calibration priors**, so a previous run's exported poses become this run's inputs and the run silently grades its own homework. Clean the tree first (`camera_registry.sanitize_and_census`) | `[VERIFIED: NA167 B7]` |
| Lay out an image tree | `04-image-input-and-handling.md` §12.3; `12-…` `F-57` | Never put a **directory junction** (or any reparse point) on the path a scene's images resolve through. RealityScan then writes **zero** XMP sidecars and reports success (`Exporting Registration completed in 8.758 seconds`, nothing on disk). Compounding it, PowerShell 5.1 `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` does not descend into junction *children*. Use real directories of **hardlinked** images with **copied** sidecars. Cost when learned: 5 h 12 m of correct GPU work discarded | `[VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-27/28]` `[UNDOCUMENTED]` |
| Edit or generate a workflow `.bat` | `12-…` `F-62`; `11-automation-patterns.md` §2 | Do not save it LF. cmd's `call :label` search is byte-offset sensitive: the same `call :run` resolved ten times and then failed with `The system cannot find the batch label specified - run`. All `.bat` and `.vbs` must be **CRLF**; re-verify after any scripted edit (e.g. "342 CRLF, 0 bare LF") | `[VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-24]` |
| Wait for a delegated command | `01-cli-fundamentals.md` §6; `11-automation-patterns.md` §2 | Do not trust a single `-waitCompleted`. Delegated commands are **queued**, and `-waitCompleted` issued before the instance picks the command up **returns immediately**, so the next command runs against a busy instance. Use the `:run` shape: delegate → grace delay → `-waitCompleted` → grace → `-waitCompleted` → check the errors marker | `[CONTRADICTED: NA167 §-waitCompleted]` |
| Diagnose any ambiguous failure | `12-…` §2 and `F-39`/`F-40` | Do not boot another instance first. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\RealityScan.log` is **global and truncated on every instance boot**, and it is the only place the real reason behind the generic `0x8000FFFF` exists. Snapshot it inside the driver, immediately after the failing call returns — and validate the snapshot, because a snapshot taken while two instances ran spliced two runs together | `[VERIFIED: NA167 B6; FINDINGS 2026-07-27]` |
| Export anything (XMP, components, models) | `04-image-input-and-handling.md` §4; `02-command-reference.md` `-exportXMP` | Three silent-zero traps in one step: (a) `appIncSubdirs` defaults **false**, so `-addFolder` over a per-camera tree adds **0 images** and the whole zone "succeeds" in 25 s; (b) `-setMinComponentSize` defaults **5**, silently excluding smaller components from export *and* selection — set it to `1`; (c) exports are **selection-driven** and `-importFlightLog` leaves images actively selected, so under `-silent` an export finishes in 0.057 s having written nothing — `-deselectAllImages` first | `[VERIFIED: FINDINGS 2026-07-23; HANDOFF 2026-07-21]` |

## Coverage

| Namespace | Documented | Total known | Where |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `RealityScan.exe` command names (incl. Help-prose-only, hidden, undocumented, and proven-nonexistent) | 218 | 218 | 02, cross-referenced from 04/06/07/08/10 |
| `-set` keys documented in the Help (tier 1) | 100 | 100 | 03 §3–§7 |
| Keys with a concrete `<Configuration>` XML source (tier 2) | 106 | 106 | 03 §8, 09 |
| Key-shaped identifiers in the 2.2 binary (tier 3, candidate namespace) | 466 | 466 | 03 §14 |
| Selection-edit keys — `-editInputSelection` and siblings (tier 4) | 68 | 68 | 03 §9, 04 §15, 07 §5, 13 |
| **Settings namespace total** | **740** | **740** | |

`RSNode.exe`'s three flags (`-hostAddress`, `-port`, `-landingPage`) are documented in
`02-command-reference.md` §17 and are deliberately not counted as `RealityScan.exe` commands.

Inclusion in tier 3 is **not** proof that `-set` accepts the key — it is a binary string, tagged
accordingly.

## Conventions

- The product is **RealityScan** / RS throughout. `RealityCapture` appears only where a literal
  string genuinely contains it: current API identifiers (`reader="RealityScan.Import.CSVFlightLog"`
  is the *current* name), legacy-but-readable extensions (`.rcalign`, `.rcproj`), and the dead
  `RealityCapture*` settings keys, which are documented **as dead**.
- Identifiers — commands, keys, XML attributes, enum values, numeric defaults — are reproduced
  **exactly**. Case matters. Nothing is paraphrased.
- Examples are Windows and runnable. Paths typed into cmd/`.bat` use backslashes and the real
  shapes used in production (`F:\na156_h2024\...`, `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\RealityScan_2.2\`),
  not `path/to/thing`.
- Section references inside a document are `§N.M`; references to another document give its exact
  filename. Failure entries are cited as `F-nn` (document 12). Open questions are cited as
  `O-nn` or `§N-Qn` in the document that owns them.
