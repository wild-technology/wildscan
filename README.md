# wildscan — ROV Photogrammetry Pipeline for RealityScan 2.2

Processing pipeline for underwater ROV photogrammetry: extract and
georeference dive imagery, batch it, and drive **RealityScan 2.2**
(Epic Games, formerly RealityCapture) through its CLI to align images and
generate textured models.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (RealityScan is Windows-only; the data-prep scripts are
  Windows-oriented too)
- RealityScan 2.2 — the scripts auto-detect the executable under
  `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\RealityScan_2.2\` (and fall back to 2.1/2.0
  and `Capturing Reality` install folders). Override with the
  `RS_EXECUTABLE` environment variable or `"realityscan": {"executable": ...}`
  in `rs_settings.json`.
- **Python 3.12 or newer** (developed and run on `py -3.13`). The pinned
  dependency set requires it: `numpy>=2.5` and `scipy>=1.18` are themselves
  Python 3.12+ only, so an older interpreter cannot resolve the install.
- One or more CUDA GPUs. RealityScan uses **all** GPUs by default; see
  [Multi-GPU](#multi-gpu) to pin instances to specific GPUs.

## Quickstart

Every Python dependency is declared in `pyproject.toml`; installing the
project installs them at the versions the shipped deliverables were built on.

```
git clone https://github.com/wild-technology/wildscan.git
cd wildscan
py -3.13 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -3.13 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Verify the checkout before running anything against real data:

```
py -3.13 -m pytest
```

Then start the TUI, which is the product entry point:

```
wildscan <workspace>
```

`py -3.13 -m wildscan <workspace>` is equivalent, and `py -3.13 main.py` runs
the lower-level interactive module chain directly.

Installing without the test suite is `pip install -e .`; `pip install -e
".[tui]"` installs only the console UI (Textual + Rich) without the geo and
imaging stack, for a machine that inspects workspaces but does not process
them. `requirements.txt` is kept in step with `pyproject.toml` for anyone
who prefers `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

> RealityScan itself is a separate Windows install from Epic Games and is not
> a pip dependency. Nira publishing additionally needs the `niraclient`
> checkout (Enterprise plan) pointed at by `NIRACLIENT_DIR` — see
> `publish_nira.py`.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main.py` | Interactive orchestrator: Extract Images → Georeference → Preprocess Images → Batch Directory → RealityScan Alignment (per-zone `AlignZone.bat`; `RS_MODULES`/`RS_NO_INTERACTIVE` env vars for non-interactive runs; a failed module stops the chain) |
| `wildscan/` | WildScan, the interactive TUI portal over the whole pipeline (`py -3.13 -m wildscan <workspace>`): session setup, resume-aware stage picking, parameter wizard, live run screen, pipeline census + final-components browser — always launching stages through the canonical drivers |
| `merge_zones.py` | Iterative component-merge driver: imports every per-zone component into a fresh scene and escalates mechanism/flags (georef merge → align+rematch → +High overlap) until the registration target is met; writes `merge_report.json` |
| `grow_zone.py` | Within-zone component growth driver: on a zone's ORIGINAL aligned scene, checkpointed global re-align → rigid `-mergeComponents` → per-component grow passes, each accepted or rolled back on the never-shrink invariant; writes `grow_report.json` |
| `run_models.py` | Models every final component of a workspace's assembly via `GenerateModel.bat`, scale-gated (metric-scale oracle per component) and smallest-first; resumable via `models_report.json` |
| `publish_batch.py` | Publishes every exported component (`exports/<comp>/obj`) to Cesium ion and/or Nira — whichever credentials are present — by driving the two publishers below; writes `publish_report.json` |
| `publish_cesium.py` | Uploads one mesh export (OBJ) to Cesium ion as a tiled 3D asset via ion's REST flow — the scripted equivalent of the GUI-only "Share to Cesium ion" button |
| `publish_nira.py` | Uploads one export to Nira through the official `niraclient` (Enterprise plan required), building the explicit typed file list Nira's docs recommend |
| `modules/camera_registry.py` | Single source of truth for the four physical rig cameras (lens, calibration groups, XMP content, filename families) |
| `geoall.py` | Standalone georeferencing (ROV nav CSV → RealityScan flight logs). The most up-to-date georeferencing implementation. |
| `poses2flightlog.py` | Post-alignment: rewrite camera locations back to UTM from the computed poses (XMP sidecars), producing a refined flight log + per-image nav-error QC |
| `decimator.py` | Copy a percentage of images to a new folder (dataset thinning) |
| `timestamp_rename.py` | Rename `cam*_TIMESTAMP.jpg` → `TIMESTAMP_cam*.jpg` and validate JPEG integrity (was the misnamed `masking.py` — it never masked; renamed 2026-08-07) |
| `organize_by_date.py` | Sort images into per-date subfolders (was `test.py`) |
| `module_base/` | Framework: `RSModule` base class, `Parameter`, `SettingsStore` |
| `modules/realityscan_interface/` | Everything that talks to RealityScan — see below |
| `modules/extract_images/`, `modules/georeference/`, `modules/preprocess_images/`, `modules/image_batcher/` | Pipeline modules used by `main.py` |
| `archive/colmap/` | Retired COLMAP scripts (reference only) — the live COLMAP line is the separate `colmap_studio` project; see `docs/COLMAP_CROSSOVER.md` |
| `flightlogs.xml`, `sensorsdb.xml` | RealityScan reference data |
| `docs/code-review-2026-07.md` | What the first-machine validation changed and why (read before trusting older assumptions about the CLI layer) |

### Preprocessing default

`Preprocess Images` applies CLAHE (clip 2.0, 8×8 tiles, L channel in LAB)
to copies under `<output>/preprocessed_images`, leaving the originals in
place — align on the processed copies, texture from the originals. The
default was A/B-measured on a zone_9 400-image subset (2026-07-21,
`testing/run_zone9_tests.py`): baseline registered 0% (no component at
all), CLAHE 2.0/8×8 registered 59.8% and beat every neighboring clip/tile
setting; gray-world white balance *reduced* registration (~34%) and is
off by default.

### Known duplication

`geoall.py` (standalone) and `modules/georeference/georeference_images.py`
(pipeline module) implement the same georeferencing workflow. The standalone
is the newer, faster implementation (multiprocessing + binary-search
timestamp matching); the module is the version wired into `main.py`. Prefer
`geoall.py` for standalone runs. When the module needs improvements, port
them from `geoall.py` rather than diverging further.

## Persisted settings (`rs_settings.json`)

All standalone scripts and `main.py` prompts remember your last answers.
Values are stored in `rs_settings.json` at the repo root (gitignored,
human-editable) via `module_base/settings_store.py`, and offered as the
default on the next run — press Enter to reuse them.

Reserved section `"realityscan"`:

```json
{
  "realityscan": {
    "executable": "C:\\Program Files\\Epic Games\\RealityScan_2.2\\RealityScan.exe",
    "instance_name": "RS1",
    "gpu_devices": "0,1"
  }
}
```

All keys are optional; omit the file entirely for auto-detection and
defaults.

## How RealityScan execution works (read before touching it)

**Every** RealityScan run goes through one execution layer —
`modules/realityscan_interface/realityscan_cli.py` on the Python side and
the shared `:run` pattern in the `RS_CLI/Scripts/*.bat` workflow scripts.
Do not add new code that shells out to RealityScan directly; reuse this
layer so monitoring and race-condition handling stay uniform.

The design (informed by hard-won lessons — see
[Lessons learned](#lessons-learned)):

1. `startRealityScan.bat` boots one persistent **headless** instance named
   `RS1` (`-setInstanceName`), or attaches to it with a fresh scene if it
   already exists, and waits for readiness by polling `-getStatus` (bounded
   at 120 s).
2. The instance is started with RealityScan's built-in monitoring hooks
   (all marker files are namespaced per instance so parallel instances
   stay isolated):
   - `-writeProgress Errors\progress_<instance>.txt 600` — progress
     stream, tailed live by `RealityScanCLI` for logging and stall
     warnings;
   - `appProcessAction=ExecuteProgram` + `appProcessExecCmd` →
     `Errors\ErrorWriter.bat` — RealityScan itself reports every finished
     process (`$(processResult)`, `$(processId)`, `$(processDuration)`).
     Completions append to `results_<instance>.log`; failures (result
     codes other than 0/1) append to `errors_<instance>.txt`;
   - `-silent <Errors dir>` so crash dialogs can never hang an unattended
     run (a crash exits with code 3 and a minidump instead).
3. Workflow scripts execute every operation through the `:run` subroutine:
   `-delegateTo <instance> <cmd>` → grace delay → `-waitCompleted` twice
   with a second grace between them (`-waitCompleted` alone can return
   prematurely before the instance picks the queued command up) → abort
   the workflow if `errors_<instance>.txt` is non-empty. Do NOT gate on
   `results_<instance>.log` growth: RealityScan 2.2 emits heartbeat
   processes through the same trigger, so "the log grew" does not mean
   "our command finished" (that check raced ahead of a running `-align`
   and was removed). The results log is history/diagnostics; the errors
   marker is the abort trigger. One command per delegation, always.
4. `RealityScanCLI.run_batch_script()` wraps the whole workflow:
   - a per-instance **lock file** (with PID liveness check) prevents two
     orchestrators from driving the same instance name concurrently;
   - a leftover instance from an interrupted run is shut down (never
     silently attached to) before the workflow starts;
   - marker files are cleared before each run so stale state can never be
     misread, and read back only **after** verified shutdown so a failure
     in the final save can never be missed;
   - **no overall timeout** — alignment/reconstruction on large datasets
     legitimately runs 10+ hours; a stall only logs a warning after 2 h of
     silence;
   - after the workflow ends, the instance is verified to have actually
     shut down via `-getStatus` before the next run may start, so
     consecutive runs can never share a scene.
5. Completion is never inferred from process names. (Historical bug: the
   old code polled `tasklist` for `RealityCapture.exe` after the executable
   had been renamed `RealityScan.exe`, so the wait always returned
   immediately and raced ahead of the CLI.)
6. **Boot mode refuses `*` as an instance name.** `*` means "first
   available instance" and a GUI/Epic-Launcher RealityScan answers it —
   so booting against it would `-quit` and then `-newScene
   -deleteAutosave` somebody's live interactive scene. Only *attach* mode
   (`finish_model.py` / `run_attach_script`) accepts `*`; it never boots
   and never resets.
7. **Workflow arguments are validated before they reach `cmd`.** Python's
   `list2cmdline` quotes only on whitespace and `cmd` re-parses even a
   quoted argument, so `& ^ | < > ( ) = , ; % ! " ` ` in a path are
   silently split, eaten, or *executed* — with the process still
   returning 0. `RealityScanCLI` raises a `ValueError` naming the
   argument instead. If an expedition folder is called `NA167, dive 2` or
   `Wreck & Debris`, rename it or pass the value through a file/env var
   (hard rule 8).

### The input image folder is WRITTEN INTO

Alignment does not treat the folder you hand it as read-only, and this
matters when you point the pipeline at your own imagery rather than a
pipeline-made zone tree:

- the in-session identity harvest **MOVES** every pose-bearing `.xmp`
  sidecar out of the tree into `<output>/identity_r<K>` and does not put
  it back (leftover pose sidecars auto-import as exact-pose priors on any
  later add — bug B7);
- remaining sidecars are **rewritten** to calibration-only content, or
  **deleted** when the filename matches no known camera;
- missing calibration sidecars are **regenerated** for recognised
  cameras.

A run whose input folder already contains pose sidecars logs a loud
warning naming the count before anything moves. Copy the folder first if
those sidecars are yours.

### Multi-GPU

RealityScan uses every CUDA GPU by default (`sfmGPUAcceleration=true` in
`Metadata/AlignmentParams.xml`) — a single instance already benefits from
the multi-GPU machine with no configuration.

To run **parallel instances pinned to specific GPUs** (e.g. two zones at
once), give each its own instance name and GPU set:

- Python: `RealityScanCLI(logger, instance_name="RS_GPU0")` and
  `run_batch_script(..., gpu_devices="0")`, or set `instance_name` /
  `gpu_devices` in `rs_settings.json`;
- Batch: set `RS_INSTANCE=RS_GPU0` and `RS_GPU_DEVICES=0` before calling a
  workflow script (`RS_GPU_DEVICES` is exported as `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
  for the launched instance).

The per-instance lock makes concurrent same-instance runs fail fast instead
of corrupting each other.

## Lessons learned

Collected from prior iterations of this repo (some of which only survive in
git history — see `git log`):

- **Delegation pickup race**: `-waitCompleted` returns prematurely when
  called before the instance has picked up the queued command. Mitigation
  (the `:run` pattern): `-delegateTo` → grace delay → `-waitCompleted`
  twice with a second grace between them. Never infer completion from
  `results_<instance>.log` growth — RealityScan 2.2 emits heartbeat
  processes through the same trigger, so a log-growth gate races ahead of
  a running `-align` (that check existed and was removed). The results
  log is history/diagnostics; `errors_<instance>.txt` is the abort
  trigger.
- **No operation timeouts**: 10+ hour alignments are normal on these
  datasets. Only *startup* (120 s) and *shutdown* (300 s) are bounded.
- **Never detect completion by process name** — see the
  `RealityCapture.exe`/`RealityScan.exe` bug above.
- **Suppress dialogs for unattended runs**: `-silent` + `appAutoSaveMode=false`;
  a modal dialog on a headless box hangs the pipeline forever.
- **`-set` keys changed with the RealityScan rename**: the app settings are
  `appQuitOnError`, `appProcessAction`, `appProcessExecCmd`,
  `appProcessActionTime` — the legacy `RealityCapture*` key names the old
  scripts used are not valid in 2.x.
- **Network drives are slow for RealityScan file operations** — export to a
  local disk first, then copy to network storage.
- **One instance, one orchestrator** — enforced by the lock file.

## Typical workflows

**WildScan** — the interactive console over the whole pipeline (Wild
Technology branding, cross-platform; RealityScan stages run on Windows,
inspection/exports review works anywhere). It censuses a results folder,
shows every stage as done/partial/pending, previews exactly what a stage
will execute (command, settings, estimate) before launching it through the
canonical drivers, streams progress, and browses the final components with
their measured scales, models and exports:

```
py -3.13 -m pip install -e ".[tui]"
py -3.13 -m wildscan F:/na156_h2024_v2
```

Deliverable export (OBJ by parts per Nira guidance, FBX by parts, ultra-dense
colored PLY) and publishing:

```
modules\realityscan_interface\RS_CLI\Scripts\ExportDeliverables.bat "D:\dive\final_assembly\assembly\Assembly.rsproj" "D:\dive\exports" "D:\dive\exports\components.names"
py -3.13 publish_cesium.py --name "IN-401 hull" --dir D:/dive/exports/<comp>/obj --input-crs EPSG:32604
py -3.13 publish_nira.py --name "IN-401 hull" --dir D:/dive/exports/<comp>/obj --niraclient C:/tools/niraclient
```

(Cesium ion and Nira both recommend the OBJ; Nira scripted upload needs an
Enterprise-plan API key, and Nira does not accept PLY point clouds — LAS/
LAZ/E57 only.)

Full interactive pipeline (extraction through per-zone alignment):

```
python main.py
```

Merge the per-zone components, then build the model on the merged result:

```
python merge_zones.py --components_root D:\dive\aligned_components --images_root D:\dive\batched_images_by_zone --output D:\dive\merged
modules\realityscan_interface\RS_CLI\Scripts\GenerateModel.bat "D:\dive\merged\attempt_merge_georef\Merged.rsproj" "Merged"
```

### Finishing a model in a running instance

`ModelToFinal.bat` takes an **already-computed** mesh through the model
back half on its own — texture → (optional simplify) → unwrap →
reproject → export → save — against a scene open in a **running**
instance (e.g. a reconstruction computed interactively in the GUI). It
never calculates a mesh and never creates a scene. Canonical example
(from `modules\realityscan_interface\RS_CLI\Scripts`):

```
ModelToFinal.bat "*" "<outdir>" <name> 4x8k true objmetric false false
```

Arguments: target instance (`*` = "first available" — the way to reach a
GUI-launched instance, which answers no named lookup), export directory,
model name, texture preset (`4x8k` = the default 8K cap), simplify
true/false, export format (`objmetric` exports the same OBJ as `obj` but
at **true scale 1.0** instead of the stock preset's Unreal-oriented
scale 100), cull polygons, correct colors. Set the `RS_SAVE_PATH`
environment variable to save the finished project to an explicit path
(bare `-save` writes back to the project's original location, which a
scene built interactively and never saved does not have).

Safety property: this workflow **attaches** to the running instance and
deliberately never calls `startRealityScan.bat` — that script issues
`-newScene -deleteAutosave` when it finds an instance already running,
which would destroy the very scene this workflow exists to finish.

Standalone zone alignment (from `modules/realityscan_interface/RS_CLI/Scripts`):

```
AlignZone.bat "D:\zones\zone_01" "D:\dive\aligned_components\zone_01" "D:\zones\zone_01\flight_log_4Q_UTM.txt" "..\Metadata\FlightLogParams.xml" zone_01 50
```

Standalone georeferencing:

```
python geoall.py
```

All prompts default to your previous answers (see `rs_settings.json`).
Set `RS_HEADLESS=0` to boot the RealityScan instance with its GUI
visible; alignment settings always come from
`modules/realityscan_interface/RS_CLI/Metadata/AlignmentParams.xml`,
never instance defaults. Design
rationale for the settings and the merge strategy:
`docs/settings-evaluation-2026-07.md`.
