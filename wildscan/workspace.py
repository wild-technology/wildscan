"""Compatibility shim - the census implementation moved to
modules/workspace_census.py (2026-08-07, consolidation step 8).

WHY: run_models.py (a repo-root driver) needed the Workspace census, and
the layering rule is that wildscan may import modules, never the reverse -
so the implementation lives in modules/ and this module re-exports it for
the TUI package and any older imports. The private helpers are re-exported
too because wildscan.session imports them (_find_flight_logs, _load_json).
