"""Reparse-point guard for the peel harvest.

The peel harvest is a PowerShell `Get-ChildItem -Recurse`, which does NOT
descend into junction children, and RealityScan writes no XMP sidecars when
a scene's images resolve through a reparse point. An image root containing
directory junctions therefore yields an empty peel on every attempt -
indistinguishable from a legitimately empty scene. See FINDINGS.md "The
peel harvest cannot cross a directory junction (2026-07-27)".

`assert_harvestable` was born in archive/campaign_drivers/run_h2024_v2.py (which retains its
own historical copy) and is promoted here so every live driver shares ONE
implementation. Tests: testing/test_harvest_guard.py.
