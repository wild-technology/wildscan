"""ONE inventory of image file extensions for the whole pipeline.

Five different literal sets used to be spelled out across
workspace_census, wildscan/session, georeference, batch_directory,
camera_registry, realityscan_interface, merge_zones and grow_zone - so a
.tif or .heif dataset was "present" to some stages and invisible to
others: the census reported two images extracted while the georeferencer
silently produced priors for one (audit 2026-08-07).

Two names, both explicit about what they mean:

``ALL_IMAGE_EXTS``
    Everything the pipeline RECOGNISES as survey imagery. Use it for
    censuses, scans and "is there imagery here?" questions.

``PROCESSABLE_IMAGE_EXTS``
    What the timestamp/copy/sidecar stages actually handle today. It is a
    strict subset, and stages that use it MUST report what they skipped
    (see ``skipped_by_extension``) rather than filtering in silence.

Widening PROCESSABLE_IMAGE_EXTS is a live-verification job, not an
offline one - RealityScan's own import behaviour for TIFF/HEIF in this
build is not established here. Tracked in
testing/VERIFICATION_BACKLOG.md.
