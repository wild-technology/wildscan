"""Unified execution layer for the RealityScan 2.2 CLI.

Every script in this repository that drives RealityScan must go through this
module so that launching, monitoring, error detection, and race-condition
handling behave identically everywhere.

How execution works
-------------------
The batch scripts in ``RS_CLI/Scripts`` boot one persistent *headless*
RealityScan instance (named ``RS1`` by default) and delegate each operation
to it with ``-delegateTo``. Delegated commands are *queued* — the delegating
process returns as soon as the command is handed over, NOT when the
operation finishes. Synchronisation therefore uses three cooperating
mechanisms, in line with RealityScan's own CLI facilities:

1. ``-waitCompleted <instance>`` after every delegated command (issued twice
   with a short grace period in between, because ``-waitCompleted`` can
   return prematurely when it runs before the instance has picked the
   queued command up — a race we have hit in production).
2. RealityScan's built-in process trigger: the instance is started with
   ``appProcessAction=ExecuteProgram`` and ``appProcessExecCmd`` pointing at
   ``RS_CLI/Errors/ErrorWriter.bat``. RealityScan itself invokes that hook
   whenever a process finishes and passes ``$(processResult)``. Every
   completion is appended to ``results.log``; failures are appended to
   ``errors.txt``. This is the source of truth for per-operation success —
   the batch scripts abort as soon as ``errors.txt`` becomes non-empty.
3. ``-writeProgress progress.txt`` on the instance, which this module tails
   to report activity and to warn about stalls. There is deliberately NO
   overall timeout: alignment/reconstruction on large datasets legitimately
   runs for many hours.

Race-condition rules enforced here:
- A per-instance lock file prevents two orchestrators from driving the same
  instance name concurrently.
- Marker files (``progress_<instance>.txt``, ``errors_<instance>.txt``,
  ``results_<instance>.log``) are namespaced per instance and cleared
  before every run, so parallel instances and previous runs can never be
  misread as the current run's state.
- After a workflow finishes, we verify via ``-getStatus`` that the instance
  actually shut down before the next workflow starts, so consecutive runs
  can never share (and contaminate) a scene.
- Completion is never inferred from process *names* (the pre-2.x code
  polled ``tasklist`` for ``RealityCapture.exe``, which silently matched
  nothing once the executable became ``RealityScan.exe``).

Multi-GPU
---------
RealityScan uses every CUDA GPU by default. To pin an instance to specific
GPUs (e.g. to run one instance per GPU), set ``gpu_devices`` in
``rs_settings.json`` under the ``realityscan`` section (e.g. ``"0,1"``), or
pass ``gpu_devices`` to :meth:`RealityScanCLI.run_batch_script`. The value
is exported as ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES``/``RS_GPU_DEVICES`` for the launched
instance. Give each concurrent instance a unique ``instance_name``.
