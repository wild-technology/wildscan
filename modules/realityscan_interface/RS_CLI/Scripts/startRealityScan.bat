:: Boots (or attaches to) the headless RealityScan instance %RS_INSTANCE%.
:: Based on the Epic Games Slovakia CLI samples, adapted for RealityScan 2.2.
::
:: The instance is started with RealityScan's built-in monitoring hooks:
::   -writeProgress          progress stream tailed by the Python orchestrator
::   appProcessAction /      RealityScan itself runs ErrorWriter.bat when a
::   appProcessExecCmd       process finishes, logging every completion to
::                           results_<instance>.log and failures to
::                           errors_<instance>.txt (files are namespaced per
::                           instance so parallel instances stay isolated)

:: Optional GPU pinning: RS_GPU_DEVICES (e.g. "0" or "0,1") restricts the
:: CUDA devices visible to this instance. Unset = use all GPUs.
if defined RS_GPU_DEVICES set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=%RS_GPU_DEVICES%

:: The hook runs through the wscript VBS shim, NOT cmd /c directly: the
:: process trigger fires for EVERY completed process (heartbeats
:: included) and a direct cmd /c pops a visible console window each time
:: - hundreds of flashing terminal windows over a long run (owner
:: report, 2026-07-23). wscript is GUI-subsystem (no console); the shim
:: runs ErrorWriter.bat hidden and synchronously. Paths are wrapped in
:: escaped quotes (\") because checkout paths routinely contain spaces;
:: without them the trigger would silently launch nothing and all error
:: detection would vanish.
:: Cache location (RS_CACHE_DIR, opt-in - unset keeps RealityScan's own
:: default). WHY THIS EXISTS: processing writes cache files to the cache
:: disk, and when that disk fills RealityScan aborts the operation and the
:: progress is lost (Epic's own "Out of Disk Space" page). The H2023 hull
:: model was killed three times this way - twice reported only as
:: "result code 2147942512" (0x80070070) until the instance log was
:: snapshotted and read "Processing failed: Out of disk space.". The cache
:: was pinned to D:ccache (1,089 GB) and filled the drive even after the
:: PROJECT was moved to another disk, because the cache never moves with it.
:: Epic warns NOT to delete cache files by hand, so relocating is the safe
:: lever. appAutoClearCache is deliberately left alone here - retention is
:: an owner policy, not a per-run decision.

:: (-stdConsole removed 2026-07-23: it allocates a console window per
:: instance boot; nothing reads instance stdout - progress comes from

::     one iteration late. Flattening the block removes both.
