:: Import every .rsalign component from a folder into a fresh scene, merge
:: them, and export the merged component.
::
:: Merge mechanisms (RealityScan 2.2, empirically verified - see
:: testing/FINDINGS.md #23-#26, #30):
::   - "merge": the -mergeComponents command. Fuses ONLY through cameras
::     shared by identity (same image path in both components). With no
::     shared cameras it exits SUCCESS and silently leaves components
::     separate - verify merges by camera count, never exit status.
::     sfmMergeGeoreferencedComponents did NOT enable overlap-free
::     merging headless, despite the official docs.
::   - "align": -align with components present - RealityScan's align
::     update; same shared-camera requirement observed.
::
:: Arguments:
::   %1 folder containing .rsalign files, OR a .complist file: a text file
::      naming one .rsalign path per line. Prefer the .complist form with
::      components at their ORIGINAL export locations: -importComponent of
::      a component file that was copied elsewhere has been observed to
::      hang indefinitely in a #timeout state (2026-07-23). A file (not a
::      delimited argument) because cmd splits unquoted ; , = into
::      separate arguments and subprocess does not quote them.
::   %2 output directory
::   %3 merged component/scene name
::   %4 merge mode: "merge" (default), "align", or "assemble" (no merge
::      operation - import every component, georeference via union log +
::      -update, save; a SINGLE component is valid in this mode)
::   %5 minimum component size for the all-components export (default 50;
::      align mode only - exportLatestComponents covers "components
::      created in the last alignment", which a plain -mergeComponents is
::      not)
::   %6..%9 optional "key:value" settings applied via -set before merging
::          (e.g. "sfmMergeGeoreferencedComponents:true"). COLON, not
::          equals: cmd splits unquoted '=' arguments in two, which both
::          broke the -set (err:7155) and aborted the workflow via the
::          errors marker. The colon is converted to '=' here.
::
:: Environment (set by merge_zones.py; env because %1-%9 are exhausted):
::   RS_MERGE_FLIGHT_LOG / RS_MERGE_FLIGHT_LOG_PARAMS - union flight log
::   + CRS params for the merge scene. REQUIRED for a georeferenced
::   result: a merged component is a NEW component, and without
::   constraints in the scene RealityScan has nothing to georegister it
::   against - the zone components' own georeferencing does NOT carry
::   over (observed NA156 H2023, 2026-07-23). After the merge, -update
::   fits all components to the imported constraints by a rigid
::   transformation, which is what georeferences the merged component.
