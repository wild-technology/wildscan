:: Model generation for an already-aligned scene - owner-specified recipe
:: (2026-07-23):
::   Generate High -> remove marginal (edge) triangles -> remove large
::   triangles (30 threshold) -> keep largest connected component ->
::   close holes -> clean model (the CLI equivalent of the GUI Check
::   Integrity / Check Topology FIX actions; the checks themselves have
::   no CLI commands) -> simplify (noise) -> generate texture ->
::   simplify (smooth) 80% x4 with clean between -> unwrap -> reproject
::   high-poly texture.
::
:: Selection semantics: RealityScan's Filter Selection
:: (-removeSelectedTriangles) removes the SELECTED triangles, so the
:: edge/large steps filter directly and only the largest-component step
:: needs -invertTrianglesSelection first.
::
:: Texture-with-holes rationale: texture is generated AFTER
:: closeHoles+cleanModel, so hole-fill triangles receive real image
:: texture with multi-band blending (underwater holes are usually
:: weakly-reconstructed but CAMERA-VISIBLE areas). The final
:: reprojection then maps between two already-manifold models - no
:: nodata patches. Never texture the holey model and reproject onto the
:: closed one. (docs/settings-evaluation-2026-07.md)
::
:: Models kept, each prefixed with the component name (see model_tag
:: below): <comp>_HighPoly_Raw (generate high), <comp>_HighPoly_Textured
:: (textured, pre-simplification), <comp>_Simplified_Textured (final).
:: The prefix is what makes running this once per component against one
:: shared project safe.
::
:: Arguments:
::   %1 .rsproj scene path (from AlignZone.bat or MergeZoneComponents.bat)
::   %2 component name to model ("" = maximal component)
::   %3 large-triangle threshold (default 30; -selectLargeTrianglesRel
::      units: multiples of the average edge length)
::
:: Daily saves (RS_PROJECTS_DIR/RS_PROJECT_LABEL/RS_PROJECT_DATE set by
:: the Python orchestrator): after texture and after the final model,
:: to RC_projects\{label}_merged_YYYYMMDD.rsproj.
