:: Mesh-only FRONT half of the per-feature model chain (2026-08-08):
:: load a merged scene, select ONE component, calculate the high model,
:: give it a feature-bound name, save - and LEAVE THE INSTANCE RUNNING
:: with the scene loaded, so finish_model.py / ModelToFinal.bat (the
:: attach-only back half) can texture/simplify/export it. The caller owns
:: quitting the instance afterwards.
::
:: WHY IT EXISTS: GenerateModel.bat's owner recipe includes unconditional
:: keep-largest-mesh-component + large-triangle culls - correct for noisy
:: hull zones, destructive for thin features (masts, a stern flag-pole)
:: that mesh as several islands. ModelToFinal.bat deliberately NEVER
:: calculates a mesh. This is the missing headless mesh step, with NO
:: cleanup: cull decisions belong to the back half's optional gentle cull.
::
:: Arguments:
::   %1 .rsproj scene path (required)
::   %2 component name to model ("" = maximal component)
::   %3 model name to assign (required; feature-bound, e.g.
::      ON2026_RH0041_RH2042_mast_a_HighPoly)
