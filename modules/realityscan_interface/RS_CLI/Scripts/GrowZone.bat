:: One within-zone growth PASS on an EXISTING zone scene, driven by
:: grow_zone.py (docs/merge-growth-strategy-2026-07.md, "Revised order of
:: operations", within-zone half). The scene is loaded from %1, operated
:: on, and saved back IN PLACE - checkpoint/rollback is the driver's job
:: (it snapshots the .rsproj + its companion data folder before every
:: mutating pass and restores them to the SAME path on rollback).
::
:: WARNING: this workflow must ONLY be pointed at the ORIGINAL zone scene
:: (the one AlignZone.bat built by adding the zone's image folder), never
:: at a scene reconstructed from component imports: importing components
:: into a fresh project does NOT bring images that are not in those
:: components - the orphan images (the precious missing-link candidates
:: this whole stage exists to register) are simply absent there, and if
:: re-added manually they carry no trajectory data until a flight log is
:: imported (owner-confirmed 2026-07-23, FINDINGS.md).
::
:: Modes (%2):
::   global    - enable ALL images and re-align: RealityScan's component-
::               merge algorithms see every cross-component tie at once.
::   component - disable ALL images, enable only the images listed in the
::               primary .imagelist (the component being grown), set the
::               features source on exactly that selection, then
::               additionally enable the secondary .imagelist (orphans,
::               features source left at per-image defaults) and align.
::   merge     - rigid -mergeComponents consolidation (cannot shrink). No
::               export: -exportLatestComponents covers "components
::               created in the last alignment", which a plain merge is
::               not (see MergeZoneComponents.bat).
::   export    - read-only: export the latest alignment's components
::               (>= min size) + identity XMP census; deliberately no save.
::   cleanup   - delete the components NAMED in the payload file (one
::               in-scene component name per line): stale/twin removal
::               after manifest-verified containment.
::
:: Arguments:
::   %1 scene .rsproj path (must exist)
::   %2 mode: global | component | merge | export | cleanup
::   %3 payload file, or "-": component mode -> primary .imagelist of
::      FULL image paths to enable (one per line); cleanup mode -> the
::      component names to delete (one per line). Always a FILE, never a
::      delimited argument (cmd splits unquoted ; , = - hard rule 8).
::   %4 features source 0|1|2 applied to the PRIMARY selection, or "-" to
::      leave per-image defaults untouched (global/component modes only)
::   %5 component export output directory (global/component/export)
::   %6 minimum component size for exports (default 50)
::   %7 secondary .imagelist (component mode: orphan images to enable
::      WITHOUT touching their features source), or "-"
::
:: Environment knobs (set by grow_zone.py):
::   RS_GROW_SELECT_CMDS  - "editsel" (default): per-selection edits go
::       through -editInputSelection "key=value" (inpEnabled /
::       aligFeaturesMode; tutorials/editselectioncommand.htm). The
::       key=value pair is passed as ONE quoted argument built inside
::       this script, so cmd never splits the '=' (the B5 hazard only
::       bites when key=value crosses a .bat argument boundary).
::       "legacy": use -enableAlignment true|false / -setFeatureSource N
::       instead (kept as the verified fallback).
::   RS_GROW_LOCK_ANCHOR  - "1": component mode only - lock the primary
::       component's camera poses (inpPose=3) before the align so the
::       well-solved component anchors the solve, and unlock (inpPose=0)
::       after. OFF by default until hardening cell U18 verifies that
::       locked cameras are guaranteed retained and that new images still
::       register onto them. Lock/unlock always uses -editInputSelection
::       regardless of RS_GROW_SELECT_CMDS.
::
:: The XMP census export runs in the ORIGINAL zone scene, so sidecars
:: keep image identity (<stem>.xmp - the ordinal-name degradation B10
:: only affects imported-component scenes). The driver reads them as the
:: registration census and restores calibration-only content (bug B7).
