"""Single source of truth for the rig cameras - loaded from cameras.json.

The registry DATA now lives in modules/cameras.json (owner per-camera /
per-rig settings, including the DATA-ONLY rig section for ON2026 Voyis).
This module parses that file at import time and rebuilds the exact
structures the pipeline has always consumed; every public signature is
unchanged. A one-release parity brace (_assert_parity below) re-asserts
the retired hardcoded tables against the JSON on every import, so a bad
edit to cameras.json is a hard ImportError naming the divergent key
instead of a silent behavior change. It is a SUBSET check: adding a new
expedition's camera/family to cameras.json is supported and does not trip
it - only changing or removing a legacy row does.

The rig carries FOUR cameras that appear under era-specific filename
families (owner-confirmed 2026-07-23):

- Zeuss      (rectilinear 23 mm full frame): 'zeuss'/'HERC' names
- Port       (fisheye 14 mm full frame):     'cammid*' or WCA 'P###C*'
- Cinema     (rectilinear 17 mm full frame): 'camlower*' or WCA 'C###C*'
- Starboard  (fisheye 14 mm full frame):     'camupper*' or WCA 'S###C*'

Calibration/lens groups are per PHYSICAL camera, never per lens type:
Port and Starboard share a lens spec but are different units with
different real intrinsics. Groups matter because the WCA JPGs are
EXIF-identical (Z CAM E2-F6, no focal tag) -- without the XMP groups
RealityScan cannot separate the cameras at all.

Mount geometry (pitch offsets, lever arms) keys off family() below, not
off the camera: the same Cinema unit sits 10 deg down under legacy
camlower names and 45 deg under WCA names. The runtime mount table is
still modules/georeference/georeference_images.py MOUNTS (superseded-by
cameras.json families[].mount, pending migration step (c+)).
