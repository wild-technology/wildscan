# Archived campaign drivers

One-shot drivers and probes written for specific NA156/H2023, H2024 and
NA167 campaign questions, archived 2026-08-07 (owner-approved
quarantine). Each answered its question; the answers live in
`FINDINGS.md`, `HANDOFF.md` and the `testing/` plans cited below. None
of these are imported by live code (`modules/`, `wildscan/`, root
scripts, or `testing/test_*.py`) — the live importers of
`run_h2024_final.py` were retargeted to the promoted guard before the
move. They are kept for the patterns they encode (phase-skip resume,
census comparison, A/B fixture builds), not for re-running: hardcoded
campaign paths and superseded workflow assumptions mean they will not
run unmodified.

| Script | What it was for | Provenance (sections that cite it) |
|---|---|---|
| `run_h2024_v2.py` | Unattended H2024 v2 driver: fresh per-zone aligns for the five H2024 zones, regression check against the 2026-07-26 baseline, then `merge_zones.py` into one assembly project. | HANDOFF.md "Uncommitted" (2026-07-27 session, `HANDOFF.md:284`) and "Exact next commands" (`HANDOFF.md:321`, the `--skip_merge` invocation). |
| `run_h2024_final.py` | H2024 final chain (owner staging 2026-07-28): non-hull merge under the overlap pair-gate → hull assembly → confirmation → per-component models. | FINDINGS.md "Final review + owner notes applied (2026-07-29)" (`FINDINGS.md:2242`, the PARTIAL `merge_report.json` phase-skip trap). |
| `run_h2024_fused_models.py` | Follow-up to `run_h2024_final.py` phase 4: measure the FUSED components' metric scale (the gate had blocked them as UNMEASURED because ordinal B10 sidecars carry no image identity) and model the ones that pass. | HANDOFF.md "What changed to get here, and why the previous answer was wrong" (`HANDOFF.md:187`). |
| `probe_d7.py` | D7 + Q9 merge-mechanism probe: zero-overlap duplicate-path pair from the smoke minis, four merge cells isolating WHAT fused the NA156 duplicate-path components. Settled D7: fusion is content-driven. | testing/MERGE_TEST_PLAN.md "D7 probe wave (2026-07-24)" (`MERGE_TEST_PLAN.md:152`); FINDINGS.md "Merge & component growth" D7 entry (`FINDINGS.md:421`). |
| `relaunch_pd6.py` | Relaunch PD-6: zone_1 clean re-align with calibration sidecars restored and the Division distortion model — the decisive test of the 0.175 hull scale error. | FINDINGS.md "Merge & component growth" (`FINDINGS.md:701`, `FINDINGS.md:710`); HANDOFF.md "Fixed this session" (`HANDOFF.md:599`, AlignZone.bat manifest handoff). |
| `ab_orientation_priors.py` | Overnight A/B: do orientation priors (ON at 15°) cause the H2024 scale collapse (zone_3 c0 at scale 0.236)? | FINDINGS.md "ON2026 model-to-final + nav prep (2026-08-04/07)" → "Nav / orientation priors" (`FINDINGS.md:2502`, the yaw-convention/UTM conversion at its line 115); HANDOFF.md "LOOSE ENDS, RANKED" (`HANDOFF.md:98`); testing/PRIORS_DISTORTION_TEST_PLAN.md. |
